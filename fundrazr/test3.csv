"2,820",Helping out The Schoors,Accident,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,,,40,"My name is Nicole and I have known both Ron and Gerrie for about
  close to three years. During that time they both have always been
  there for me not only when I needed them, but also when I didn't know
  I needed that extra support. The absolute love I have for them
  couldn't be described in words. At this time all we know is Ron is currently at UCSD hospital and has
  spent at least six hours in surgery. The boating accident he was in
  might cause him to lose his arm, but it also might cause a financial
  burden. To help lessen the blow I would like you to consider donating
  whatever you can give at the time being. Believe me, I know some of us
  live pay check to pay check, so if you can give great and if not, no
  big deal. If you find yourself wondering if or what you can donate, just think
  back on the last time either Gerrie or Ron helped you. Try to hold on
  to that moment and think about how selfless they have been not only to
  you, but to others. Maybe you can't donate money, that isn't a
  requirement either, that would just be a bonus. You could donate a
  home cooked meal, a Facebook post of encouragement/love, a few hours
  of your day supporting them emotionally, praying for them, or whatever
  else you can come up with. Please don't feel any pressure to provide a
  monetary donation. My main goal is to show them that they are loved and we are all here
  to support them in this challenging time. Any money raised will be
  given directly to Gerrie for her to take care of the finances. if you
  have any questions please feel free to reach out to me directly thru
  Facebook or my email, nicolebratman@gmail.com . I appreciate everyone's time and support and thank you all in advance. Here is a few news links on the accident: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155723550849940&id=68621004939 http://via.kswbtv.com/fq5cg",https://fundrazr.com/01GcL4

542,Let's Help BigJohn Fix His Home,Accident,U.S. Dollar,,of $7.5k goal,,,23,"Some of us know John, aka BigJohn, as being a great singer and a
    fun guy. Some of us know John as someone who is passionate by the
    Asylum Community. And some of us don't really know John. But regardless of who or what does, he's been through some tough
    moments the past few days. Hurricane Harvey devastated a
    considerable part of Texas and John has been greatly impacted by it. Fortunately, John and his family are safe. But his home, on the
    other hand, is not - or, at least, not entirely. He'll need money to
    repair his house and give his family a decent place to live again. It has suffered several damage. Some of that on the
  roof, on the outside, and some of them on the inside. At the same time, the hurricane has also taken away his mother's
  work, which was at a local church in his city. His wife, who was also
  going to start working at the very same church, won't be able to work
  there anymore. That and the whole tragedy had led John to expect some financial
  issues. Nobody could assume mother nature would hit so hard and so
  suddenly. The entire repair is estimated to be at $7,500. As someone said before, ""at times like this, we set aside
    our differences and help each other out"". So, if you can help John with any amount, I'm sure he'll be very
  thankful. Even if we can't reach our goal completely, I'm sure
  this would provide John some great help. Good luck, my friend John! Let's all spread the word.",https://fundrazr.com/helpbigjohn
"6,972",Let's get Shelley vertical again!!!,Accident,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,,,66,"Shelley Drake has been a dear friend, neighbor & partner in crime
  for quite some time now. On the evening of May 19th, on her way home
  from work, she was hit on her motorcycle by a car. She was ambulanced
  to Harborview Hospital & had a 5 hour surgery the next mroning to
  repair her broken femur, fibula, ankle & disattached patella.
  Sadly, we believe her Kawasaki KLR 650 may also be totalled. She is currently recovery from surgery at the hospital & will
  most likely need to be off work for a couple months. If you know
  Shelley, this will NOT be an easy task! She likes to GO, GO, GO!!! She
  is constantly working, picking up extra shifts for folks at work,
  helping her friends out & socializing when & if time permits. All funds raised will be used to support Shelley's recovery, help pay
  her expenses while she's off work and to help cover medical expenses.
  We will update you of those expenses as they arise. Any contribution you can give to Shelley is GREATLY APPRECIATED!! She
  is an incredibly kind-hearted person & is constantly helping &
  giving to others. (Infact, ironically enough I can remember a very
  similar situation where a neighbor woman who is also a well-loved
  local bartender also had surgery on her leg & was off work for a
  few months about 2 years ago....Shelley, was terribly concerned about
  how she was going to be able to make it not working & made sure
  that she donated to help her out! Irony.....) We have no idea what her
  medical bills and expenses will be right now, so I'm just throwing a
  number out there. We will update it as we know more! We expect Shelley to make a FULL recovery & hopefully be back up
  on her bikes sooner than later! In the mean time, we need to keep her
  focused on healing & getting back to 100%!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY & SUPPORT FOR HER!!!!
  If you know and are a friend of Shelley's you know exactly how she is
  & that she would be bending over backwards to do the same for you.
  Now, let's get her back on those bikes asap!!!",https://fundrazr.com/71Eyr1

  She loves her work and stays busier than anyone I know. She supports
  herself through freelance developmental editing, bilingual
  translation, and research. She is an avid and car-less cyclist,
  gardens, writes, volunteers with an environmental organization and a
  local theater, makes incredible art and crafts, helps others organize
  their work, does yoga… I could go on and on. Last weekend she had an accident that severed the tendon in her
  thumb. It’s amazing what all you CAN’T do without a thumb. Erin had
  surgery earlier this week and is wearing a cast that covers most of
  her hand. She is truly devastated. She is unable to do the things she
  loves to do but, most importantly, she can’t ride her bike (her only
  means of transportation), she can’t work, she can’t even type. Her friends that live nearby are helping with household chores,
  meals, and trips to the store, the doctor, therapy, etc. But she has
  multiple jobs that she will not be able to do for at least 12 weeks.
  She needs help keeping a roof over her head and the lights on as well
  as paying medical, surgical, and therapy costs. Twelve (12) weeks is a
  long time to go without a paycheck and she needs a little help from
  her friends. Please join with me to get this vital member of our community through
  this tight spot. Give what you can or reach out and let her know how
  valued she is. Erin is not on Social Media but please share widely

  on her ""hands"" again by gathering some extra funds for her
  while she heals. Rachel was involved in an off highway vehicle accident on 10/28
  resulting in the loss of her index finder and damage to her middle
  finger. She has some expensive out of pocket medical bills.
  Additionally, since Rachel's profession is as a Horse Trainer she will
  be limited on her horse training abilities until she heals and gains
  full use of her left hand again, however she will still be able to be
  still coach riders and give lessons. For those of you who still would like trail or arena lessons or
  coaching, she is still making herself available as long as you can
  help groom and saddle the horses, she can still ride safe and trained
  horses at this time. Please continue to recommend Rachel and schedule
  lessons with her to help her get back on track financially during this
  tough time. Rachel is an excellent coach for riders helping them gain
  confidence and skills out on the trail with their horses. Contact her
  on her facebook page at Shackelford.Equine or 530-210-9213. As you can imagine her hand injury is VERY painful and will be
  wrapped up for quite some time. Think about how many things we all use
  both hands for and imagine doing everything - getting dressed, washing
  hair, driving, typing, riding with one hand! If you have the ability to contribute ANY funds to Rachel it will be
  much appreciated. As her friend I have set up this fundraiser so it's
  easy and linked directly to her own PayPal account. Rachel will know
  who contributed so she can thank each of you personally. Rachel is staying wonderfully positive throughout this traumatic

"11,964",Template Geometry SALE,Accident,Australian Dollar,,of $11k goal,,,67,"Thanks for engaging with this fundraiser. The Ambulance that picked her up had a deal going with the local
  hospital and would not take her to the western run hospital down south
  that she requested. Juliet is a nurse and was not comfortable with a
  few protocols that were not met...and some downright obvious mistakes.
  However Ceremonies were about to begin and she decided to go ahead and
  hold them . Halfway through the Ceremony days the pain worsened
  considerably and she felt not only was the cast wrong and crushing her
  ulna bone, she felt the Radius had come out of alignment. After
  Ceremonies we got her to BIMC in Nusa Dua. A bone was disconnected and
  her wrist crooked. The wrong kind of cast had been used. It didn't
  help that instead of resting she had been working 9 days straight,
  holding 11 Ceremonies. Not to mention the 3 days preparation. Although
  Jules didn't want to succumb to a metal insert it became clear that it
  was now the best, if not the only, option. Too much time had lapsed
  for a true set. BMIC has a great reputation. She has had a high
  quality titanium plate and screws from Switzerland fitted. This plate
  should integrate with the bone structure. Unfortunately the western run hospital did not recognise the
  insurance that came with our working visa and the costs come to Rp 120
  million...which is just under USD$10.000. To cover the costs we are going to hold a geometry sale.",https://fundrazr.com/11Hpe9
"1,170",Please help Robert pay for his life-saving surgery,Health,U.S. Dollar,"Mar 12, 2018",of $15k goal,,,6,"My name is Holly and I am doing this fundraiser for Robert's medical
  expenses. He has been one of the Three JellyBeans since 1971; we lost
  Bret Short, our other jellybean in October 2016. Robert has a long and difficult medical history, starting with
  his near-fatal wreck (as a passenger when an on-coming car nailed him
  and his friend) when we were in high-school. It was a long road back
  but he made it. He has the most giving heart of anyone I know, and truly would
  fit the cliche of giving someone the literal shirt off of his back. He
  is a very talented contractor/handyman and has worked for himself for
  many, many years. Like a lot of others these days, he has no health insurance. Robert had been having pains in his legs for a very long time
  that were mostly relieved by rest (rest being a thing Robert rarely
  gave himself). Fortunately, his neighbor flies for LifeFlight and
  recognized the pain, now unrelieved by rest, the ghost-white shade of
  his right leg and its icy coldness as being a serious problem and took
  him to the ER on Sunday (Jan. 7th). He has had many expensive
  diagnostic tests and imaging studies to isolate the problem and
  develop the treatment plan. The fantastic news is the heart cath showed only minor issues
  that can be treated with a statin. The dreadful news is his right
  iliac artery is 100% blocked and the left is 97%. The endarterectomy
  and possible stenting should be straightforward but for the fact that
  access is problematic due to the extreme amount of scar tissue from
  his long-ago car accident. As of this writing, he is on Day 4 of
  hospitalization and is in pre-op awaiting the surgery. With the
  blockage he has, not having the surgery would result in gangrene and
  ultimate loss of his limbs. Not acceptable!! The recovery, if all goes as planned, shouldn't be much worse
  than those having a femoral-access heart cath. A day of
  flat-on-the-back, then gradual resumption of the activities of daily living. Robert has a sister, who has a family with its own health issues
  and she herself has recently suffered a stroke. She is a retired
  schoolteacher and even the family resources are limited. I am helping Robert to navigate the options with the hospital's
  social worker and financial assistance departments, and to negotiate
  downward the final medical bills. Nonethless, they will be many and
  massive. The last thing Robert needs is stress about how he will pay
  for this. Being self-employed, no work means no pay. Having a highly
  physical job, light duty restrictions for a while greatly impacts his
  ability to earn a living. What he does have is a vast support group of friends, many for
  forty years or more. And while we all have our own financial issues,
  the power of crowdsourcing means even small amounts from friends,
  extended friends, and perhaps some compassionate and generous
  strangers will help him to meet his medical bills, and make sure the
  lights stay on. I will make sure food stays in his fridge, that he has
  the transportation to medical appointments he needs, and have offered
  him my guest room and ""nursing skills"" as he recovers. I ask you all to contribute however you can -- nothing is too
  small an amount. I of course obtained Robert's permission to raise
  these funds, and he agreed (although he's not a fan of the limelight,
  much less of sharing his needs: he has volunteered for years with the
  Red Cross, going in when families are burned out of their homes to
  provide lodging, food, and clothing, and he is far more comfortable
  being the helper, not the person in need). If you don't know Robert but you know me, please consider giving
  anyway. Since losing my beloved husband to metastatic colon cancer the
  week before Thanksgiving, I have been heartbroken and lost and in
  search of a purpose. THIS is now my purpose so any support you can
  give is as meaningful to me as it is to Robert. Sincere and heartfelt thanks in advance from me and from Robert,
  for reading to the end, and for giving whatever you can. N.B.: While not required by this site, Robert and I both feel a
  moral obligation to report how any funds raised are spent. We will not
  identify, for example, a specific doctor by name; however, we would
  share that ""$xxx was paid to the vascular surgeon at Piedmont
  Hospital for the surgery,"" or ""$xxx to the hospital for room
  and related charges,"" or ""$xx to the pharmacy for his
  medications."" There's just so much fraud and scammy stuff in the
  world, we hope this provides confidence to the donors. [I will provide an update after the surgery and as he
  progresses. This could be a very long road.]",https://fundrazr.com/61Jmqc

      by Krisandra Rufus in April,
  2015 . It started when Rufus' nephew messaged her saying
    he was homeless and hungry. ""So I came down to bring him
      some food and he had all these friends down here and I thought,
      'Well, I can't just feed him, I have to feed everybody - I can't
      see them not eat'"". Over the months, several volunteers joined the group which now
    serves an average of 70 people per evening or more 7 nights per
    week.  With dedication and hard work we also became a BC
    Incorporated Society.  In addition to the home cooked meals, the
    group also gathers (or purchases) seasonal clothing, sleeping
    bags, tents, warm blankets and provides additional supports such as
    'hand-crocheted plastic sleeping mats'. We have also helped over 12 people transition off the streets
    and into treatment - ""We Believe"" is Krisandra's motto! With the money raised through Crowdfunding and other
      fundraising activities we will continue to purchase nutritious
      food to feed and support our Elders, family and friends who live
      on the streets; those at risk of being homeless and those living
      in poverty conditions in Campbell River, BC. We understand that everyone is entitled to a home. We are also
      currently working towards securing a 24/7 facility where we can
      operate out of and grow into providing more resources and
      collaborating with other community organizations. Our goals are simple but we know the difficult challenges we
      have faced in continuing to provide the basics of food and
      advocate for a permanent building for those that often don't have
      a voice.  All our volunteers purchase items out of their own
      pockets often at their own personal hardship. We are now asking that you help Krisandra Rufus and the countless volunteers of the Grassroots Kind Hearts Society continue
      with our vision.  Please also SHARE this crowdfunding campaign and video. Thank YOU.  ""We Believe""",https://www.blackpress4good.com/grassrootskindheartsociety

"1,660","Life As an Amputee - ""Rapha's Not-so-Luxury Legs""",Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $11k goal,,,27,"Hello everyone, My name is Leandro Correa and my ""little' brother Raphael Correa
  has been a LAKA(Left Above Knee Amputee) since May 4th, 2013. I love
  him to death and have always been by his said through all 23 years of
  his life thus far. At first he was active and trying to live through the loss of his
  leg and he was doing well with what he had; researching all the
  prosthetic legs out there and actually trying some of them out at Mary
  Free Bed. If you know Raphael, you know he used to be a very active
  young man and could smile for dayss.. He hasnt been smiling much lately. With the pressure of being in the Andrews University DPT program
  and learning to do every daily task in a new way without a limb has
  taken a huge hit on him. (Hopping in and out of the bathroom every
  morning; wishing he didnt have to get up.. And the list goes on and
  on.) He's angry inside and wishes he would have never left the house
  that day and worse, wishes his journey in this world could have ended
  at the pole that day and the next thing he would have seen is the
  glory of our Father and Lord, Jesus Christ calling him to live eternally. I love my brother and it hurts me to see his hurting everyday that
  goes by.. There have been good days but they havent been enough to
  cancel out all the bad feelings and anger he goes through. Im crying out to all our friends and loved ones who want to see
  Rapha's beautiful smile back on his face for a very long time. We all
  know we dont belong here in this sinful/sorrowful planet and we hope
  to see Jesus' second coming ASAP but our reality for now, is here on a
  place we call Earth. In order for Rapha to get back on his feet and
  feel fulfilled again with God by his side, he needs to be able to
  experience the sweetness of life here on earth that he used to before
  he lost his leg. Running, bicycling, snowboarding, hiking, working
  out, were all things he truly enjoyed but now they have all become a
  burden without the right equipment. Amputees suffer with the loss of a limb, or 2, or 3 and they need
  something to replace their loss. In my brother's situation, he needs
  various legs in order to live a ""normal"" life and do things
  he enjoys. But those legs arent cheap! He was blessed to recieve a
  $60k Ossur Rheo 3 knee through his insurance at no cost other paying
  his monthly premium of $65; HUGE BLESSING! But when it comes to
  activity prosthetics for running, biking, snowboarding, etc, the USA
  health insurance system believes that those are luxuries and not
  necessary for daily living. I strongly disagree with that because in
  order to have a mentally, physically, and spiritually healthy life, we
  need to explore God's creation and STAY ACTIVE. My request from all of you today is to truly think about my brother
  Raphael and his well-being and help him achieve his goals. Together we
  can do BIG things! An Ottobock 3S80 knee with a 1E90 Sport Sprinter
  carbon foot is the setup he tried at Mary Free Bed and it costs about
  $8k for that running setup. The Moto Knee made by Biodapt Inc with the
  Versa foot allows him to snowboard and do all the outdoor activities
  he enjoys and that costs about $10k. So as you can see $18k is our
  goal in order to get the proper equipment for the daily activites he
  once loved to do. We have tried fundraising with AKA shirts that he created here and
  there whenever he gets called to share his testimony in different
  locations but we havent been able to get anywhere near our goal of
  $18k. If 1000 ppl (AU, GNYC, and others we may know that are willing
  to join) got together and donated $20, that ALONE would raise up
  $20,000! I believe thats a very feasible task. The $20,000 will cover
  the equipment costs and travel expenses to where they will be bought
  and installed; a socket will also need to be made for each leg. Please
  share your thoughts and help Raphael Correa continue to push on and
  see what God has instore in his life. PS - the cars you may see in our pictures and etc are all
  investments in order to pay for school so please don't think Raphael
  is abusing the help he gets from all of you.. God Bless you all and

  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,

  used for basic living and medical expenses for Zach in his time of
  need. All help is greatly appreciated. Thank you ALL. <3 The following is Zach's ""Facebook Group"" where he shares

    the App Store (per year) . To compare: the fee to Google to
  list the app in the Play Market was 25$, once. The hourly wage for a the developer of the iOS version would most
  likely take >30$ per hour . It probably took more than 200 hours for me get the app to this

300,Help Challenger X become a reality!,Busines,Canadian Dollar,"Feb 28, 2018",of $200k goal,,,5,"My name is Candace, I want to tell you a little about my story. I
  recently had some huge changes in my life. I made a choice, a big,
  scary, intimidating choice. Six years ago I left an abusive husband.
  It was one of the scariest things I ever had to do. I packed up my 3
  kids, left and rebuilt our lives. I was unhealthy, both physically and
  mentally. With help, I worked hard and managed to overcome my
  depression and maintain it medication free. Physical activity became a
  big part of my life and of my recovery. I am a single mom of 3 amazing kids. I spent time working on myself,
  my divorce and helping my children transition into the new life we
  were creating together. Once all my kids were in school I decided it
  was time for me to do the same. I applied and was accepted to Mohawk
  College. Two years later, I graduated, with honours, form the Health,
  Wellness and Fitness program. As part of that program we had to design
  a business in our field for the final project. From that, the idea of
  Challenger X was born. The project and the concept was ranked in the
  top 5 best of the class and placed second at the end-of-year pitch
  competition, called Fit-to-Pitch. Since graduation I have been working on the business and acquiring
  the necessary certifications and education to bring Challenger X to
  life. This project has become my life and my dream. Challenger X is an indoor obstacle course for individuals looking to
  go far beyond the traditional gym experience. We have developed an
  electronically timed indoor obstacle course and training centre using
  wearable technology that revolutionizes personal fitness on a micro level. There is currently no facility in the Hamilton area that offers
  obstacles similar to those one would come across in an outdoor
  obstacle race. Challenger X provides and innovative and original
  approach to fitness development. Clients can challenge the obstacle
  course, attend group classes and/or purchase personal training. The
  time it takes a client to complete the course itself is used to test
  the client's current fitness level and helps design a personal plan
  for that client to reach their fitness goals. The client is given
  immediate feedback to their account where they can log on to their
  dashboard, either on our website or the smartphone app, to see their
  results and compare it to past results on the course. Challenger X
  offers a personalized, empowering fitness experience like no other in Hamilton. To make this dream a reality I need your help to build up capital.
  Anything you can contribute would be a tremendous help. I believe in
  this idea. I believe that Hamilton needs a facility like this one. I
  believe in who I am and in my abilities. I believe that every day I am
  working towards the greatest version of myself and I am leading by
  example. Showing people that change is not to be feared, that growth
  can only happen through change. I am helping people play a little
  outside their comfort zone, it’s ok to be scared, it’s ok to be
  uncomfortable. Most of my best experiences in life happened just on
  the other side of fear.",https://fundrazr.com/01JTEf

160,Please help me tell  people they are deeply loved.,Busines,Canadian Dollar,,of $30k goal,,,4,"Help Get An Important Message Out To Spiritual Seekers Like You This is a wonderful universe, set up so that we humans
    could evolve to understand it. We now have a very special
    place within it! About 4% of all humans now living would like to live more
  Love-focused lives, but 85% of humans don’t even believe that there is
  any Truth in the universe. In addition, there are 11% who are trying
  to evolve through the several hope-producing stages of at least living
  in evolving Logic. None of these are helpful in having us leave the
  existential Fear of the rest of humanity behind. For you to live in
  Love requires that you relinquish a Fear-base and start to fully live
  with a Love-focus. The ways of perceiving our universe, as well as our
  place within it, are very different once you step into that process of
  focusing upon Love. I have spent just under two decades learning about all of the above
  and writing a string of books as I learned each further step along my
  journey. Once a teacher has learned a new thing, those who follow that
  leader find it both easier to learn, and can do the learning more
  quickly than the teacher/leader did. Although there is more I would
  like to learn, I believe that it is now time for me to put most of my
  efforts into bring what I have learned to the attention of those like
  you who are discovering that you really do want to live a more
  Love-focused life. Have you been effectively told that you are Destined to become Love
  Incarnate, a living example of Love? That is a Truth of humans and
  this universe. Have you been told that this universe is uniquely set
  up to have species such as humans evolve; then start to investigate
  their possible Destinies? Most likely not! It is much more likely that you have been told (by those who do not
  understand how little that they know) that this is a random universe
  and that you are just an accidental, purposeless outcome of it.
  Reality could not be further from that badly-formed viewpoint. Ongoing
  Science at several levels, and Philosophy as well, indicate that we
  humans are here on purpose and that we are very special indeed, as is
  this universe of ours! Because of the volumes of nonsense out there,
  many will find it both easier and more efficient to learn from what I
  have written, and even from other things that I am already drafting,
  rather than trying to go it alone. What I need, in the short-term, is to assemble enough funding to
  engage others (where I am inefficient or as yet untrained), and
  provide a comfortable environment for my learning and developing how
  to do better marketing. That is what this FundRazr project is all about. When my books are much better known, and I am out and about talking
  about them, or teaching their essential messages, I am sure that you
  will be very proud to have helped this great and hopeful message
  become better known. I will certainly be very thankful for your help
  in making it available to those who want it! My evolving website is www.jesuislaplume.com and my
  Amazon author page is www.amazon.com/Jesuis-Laplume/e/B00DCFMZD0/ so
  please visit them to learn more about me and my many books. If you buy any of them, be sure to leave a review that helps other
  seekers who are looking for resources that they could use during their

  founder and staff have created such an amazing ecosystem to support
  the kids, and it's working. Students are outperforming schools across
  the state, they have winning sports teams, and it serves as a
  community center and location to host and support anything the
  residents in the area need. From being a sanctuary to families who may
  be targeted by ICE to staffers going the extra mile to help support
  the kids in difficult situations at home- they're doing it all. Even
  the meals are cooked on site, organic and from scratch. As a journalist and filmmaker, the very first thing my mind wants to
  do is show the world this ecosystem the founder and his staff have
  built, and show the real challenges and barriers they and students
  face every day. So ok- say I make a film. And people watch and are
  moved by it. Then what? One of the biggest challenges journalists and filmmakers face- those
  of us who are driven to do what we do by an authentic place, to get
  these messages and stories out to the world to affect positive change,
  is what happens after. You pour yourself into your work, giving up
  time with friends and family, and it airs and.... where does the
  impact start and end? The other side of it is the people that give their time for free, let
  you into their lives for days, weeks, maybe years. What do they get? There is a hole here, spaces that need to be connected. This project aims to connect these places- the air between a film
  being made and being viewed, and the people and issues and communities
  that allow us into their worlds, and have a direct need NOW that can
  be addressed by those who watch. Smaller non-profits, schools, youth organizations across the country
  need exposure to get funding. How can we help them get it? I have landed in a place where I am designing the tools we need to
  address this issue, so films can have a lifeline after they are seen,
  and the subjects have a way to benefit from the time being given to
  our projects. This campaign will serve to support myself and my partner in our
  efforts to start filming with this school and design and work out the
  kinks to creating this new digital space. What is needed now are basics- some physical hear, some software, and
  a base fund to pay my crew. I will ask for your support and also much-needed discretion, the NYC
  media world is indeed a shark tank, with plenty of people who love to
  hear a great idea, swoop in and take it out from under you. For that
  reason I have created this campaign and will be sharing it among my
  close knit community and ask that you please do not share on social
  media, email only. And also why I am not including specifics as to our
  organization's name or the school, and people. I hope to reach 5K in the days ahead so we can plow onwards, and will
  be sharing photos and small videos along the way with updates to all
  of you who choose to support. Photos I have posted are from previous doc shoots around the country
  last year- that experience brought me here- and to the realization

  that are brought together and created along the way. I will update

"7,163",Stop Watering and Start Growing With Dew Harvest,Busines,U.S. Dollar,"Feb 11, 2018",of $20k goal,,,32,"A few years ago, I took a break from studying medicine to read one of
  my favorite magazines from my younger years - Popular
  Science .  In that edition, they were awarding their innovations
  of the year, the first LED white light bulbs, IPads, etc.  The Grand
  Prize winner wasn't an electronic invention at all, however.  It was a
  cylindrical basin with a corrugated lid with precisely zero moving
  parts, designed by biomimicry of the natural world for the very needed
  purpose of reversing the growth of deserts worldwide.  This device, a
  Dutch invention called the Groasis Waterboxx, was meant to provide
  everything needed by a young tree to get established in a harsh
  environment - water was provided by the basin and collected on the lid
  from morning dew and occasional rainfall, the basin prevented
  evaporation of soil moisture and kept the base of the plant at a
  constant temperature.  I eventually bought a few of the Waterboxxes to
  try myself, and was amazed by the results.  Trees I could never get to
  grow before, like the giant sequoia planted in my Midwestern climate,
  did wonderfully with the Waterboxx.  I soon expanded to growing other
  trees and then whole gardens with this invention, eventually writing a
    book, The Waterboxx Gardener , so others could do the same. 
  We began our company, Dew Harvest, LLC, in 2013 to sell the Waterboxx
  in the United States. While our company has sold thousands of Waterboxxes at DewHarvest.com
  since our founding, we are still having to import pallets of
  Waterboxxes from Holland a few at a time, an expensive and time
  consuming process.  We plan to use the money from this campaign to
  expand our business, lower the price of the Waterboxx to our customers
  by bringing over whole shipping containers of Waterboxxes, and to
  eventually begin producing the Waterboxx here in the United States. The Waterboxx is truly needed, as we explain in our video.  The
  triple threats of increasing carbon dioxide, worsening water scarcity,
  and poor nutrition causing diabetes and obesity can all be solved by
  use of this incredible invention.  Personal, community, and church
  gardens could sprout throughout the country with the Waterboxx, as
  could tree plantations and woodlands with very little effort.  If ever
  there was an invention that could change the world for the better, the
  Waterboxx is it! Please help us realize our dream of having Waterboxx planted gardens
  and trees throughout the United States by offering a small pledge of
  support.  Larger pledges will get our E-Book emailed to you or even
  Waterboxxes (and our E-Book) for your own garden! Our crowdfunding campaign will run from January 13, 2018 to February
  12, 2018.  All contributions will be handled by WePay (for credit and
  debit cards) or PayPal for the security of your personal information. Thank You and Happy Planting!",https://fundrazr.com/DewHarvest

  the biggest challenges and life changing processes I’ve ever gone
  through. It altered my perception of how to analyze life’s daily
  experiences in a way I could formulate and share it for the benefit
  and enjoyment of others—including the stuff no one likes to discuss
  openly in public (getting robbed, being hit on by a monk, and cultural
  experimentation with psychedelics come to mind). My goal is to get
  this book out to as many people and fellow travelers as possible to
  share these moments and misadventures. But what I need now is to get to that final step. I need your

180,Introducing Aquaponics into the Greek market,Business,Euro,,of €2k goal,,,7,"Hi, my name is Nicolas Bagkos and I come from Greece. In these difficult times with the economical crisis very few job
  opportunities are presented. The National Strategic Reference
  Framework (NSRF) for startups entrepreneurship, gives the opportunity
  to some of us take the risk and build an innovative company supported
  by the EU. My proposal to built a company that mainly is involved in novel
  patented constructions of aquariums, and especially aquaponic ones,
  has been accepted and preapproved. Aquaponics is a very new
  method/system for the Greek market and currently is limited to amateur
  pastime. Eventually this technology will enter the market, as
  Aquaponics gain ground worldwide. That's why I would like to do the
  customised introduction of Aquaponic systems in my country and create
  a non existent market. I have roughly a month to rent the appropriate place to house my
  startup company, before the final approval for the funding is to be
  given. I have found the place and I have to rent it as soon as
  possible. Unfortunately, I don't have the initial capital to pay in
  advance and this is the reason that I have started this campaign. With donations over 80€, I will post you one of these innovative
    and stylish aquariums. Donations over 30€, I will post you the hydroponic part of the
    system, customized to your needs. It includes the grow bed for the
    plants, LED lights for the plants and the fish, and the
    hydroelectric mechanism that feeds the lights. Less than 20€, I will post you promotional gifts, such as
    T-shirts, breloques and other cool stuff.",https://fundrazr.com/31DJF6
"6,743",Bookkeeping for Change - Phase 2,Business,Canadian Dollar,,of $6k goal,,,46,"August 2017 Dear Supporters For the past 2 years I have been working in Uganda with a local
  accounting firm. In my free time I meet with groups who want to learn
  how to improve their financial situation. One such group is the
  Osukuru United Women's Network in Tororo, eastern Uganda. This summer we ran a pilot program with half of the 40 savings groups
  in the Network to test if keeping a financial diary of their cash and
  credit transactions would lead to improved accountability and better
  financial decision making. The pilot's success was due, in a large part, to the commitment and
  passion of the Project Coordinator - Stephen Okolett, a retired
  teacher and husband of the Chair of the Osukuru Network. Stephen and I developed a program to train 16 unemployed high school
  graduates, who live in the same area as these women, in basic
  bookkeeping and financial management. Working in pairs these trainees
  met weekly with the savings groups to teach the women how to use the
  Cash Book and Credit Sales and Purchases Book. The results have been amazing. I visited the project this week to
  meet the interns and half of the 20 groups. The women described how
  bookkeeping has brought harmony and unity to their families and their
  communities. With transparency and accountability, husbands no longer
  accuse wives of mismanagement. Mothers no longer accuse their children
  of stealing. And loans between friends, credit sales and purchases no
  longer result in loss due to forgetfulness or arguments over amounts
  borrowed and paid. The simple act of record keeping on a daily basis engages the entire
  family. Many of the women are illiterate, except for numbers, so each
  night, the children, and sometimes the husbands, will help to update
  the ledgers. Using a simple coding system, the women can see how their businesses
  are doing. For some it was a revelation to find out they were actually
  losing money. Making the decision to find a better income generating
  activity immediately improved their financial circumstances. Keeping a financial diary has also managed to reduce spending.
  Because they have a code for 'unnecessary expenses' everyone is much
  more conscious and careful with how they spend their money - which
  means there's more money available for food, medicine and school fees.
  There was an interesting discussion over whether they should code
  'payments to husbands' as 'unnecessary'! The trainees were also eager to share how the program has affected
  their own spending habits. It's given them new insights into how they
  can control their purchase decisions and take responsibility to
  improve their financial circumstances. Our first Fundrazr campaign raised $4,000. This covered printing 2
  books for 650 women and the 3 month trainee program. We need to raise another $2,000 to print books for the rest of the
  Osukuru Network and run a 1 month training program.  With 3 months
  experience under their belts, the trainees can now complete the
  training in 4 weeks. I hope you will join in to support Phase 2 of Bookkeeping for Change.
  Once this is successfully completed, the next step will be to write a
  grant to scale up implementation. Thank you for your support! If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at rhoffman@ahuganda.com",https://fundrazr.com/Bookkeeping_for_Change
915,Please help Krista pay rent and pursue a dream!,Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,,,10,"Hi friends. I am so lucky to have so many friends to have supported me
    emotionally through the years, through being homeless and some other
    dark things in my past.  I need help again, but just of a different
    sort.  I need your help to follow my heart and my passion.  At some
    point I had an epiphany experience and realized my calling was to
    work with kids (especially those that society misunderstands) and
    nothing makes me feel alive like creating art.  Working with kids,
    and creating art got me through several dark years of being
    homeless, and other tough situations.  Now, I am desperately working
    towards getting my life to a place where I am again pursuing the two
    things that I love. I have been given an opportunity to work at Anishanbe Academy,
    an amazing school focused on Indiginous youth.  If I take this job,
    I will be taking a huge cut in pay and hours.  The silver lining is
    that I could kickstart some of the art business ideas I've been
    dreaming of, but haven't had time for.  Most specifically, I am
    hoping to start a henna business. In order to do this I need time to create and photograph my
    work, to market myself, to create a website and get clients.  It
    will be a little while before this is a viable income. In the meantime, I am care giving for my mom, who is very sick.
     She is so sick that she couldn't handle a move right now, and so I
    pay half her rent every month since I've moved out, so that she can
    stay there (she couldn't afford the place on her own). At some point
    I hope to buy a duplex, and have her move in with me.  This would
    save me so much expense, and I could care for her better if she were
    just upstairs from me. In the meantime, this is what I have to do. We do what we need
    to do for family. Years ago, my mom and I were homeless, and
    incurred a lot of credit card debt staying in hotels (we stayed in
    shelters the first time we were homeless, but were able to stay in
    hotels the second time, which was really a blessing with my mom's
    declining health). While my mom is a wizard with finances and we've
    found a way to pay the initial charges off, we've had to put other
    things on the cards to keep a float.  We are still trying to get
    ahead. I feel trapped in a job that is keeping me from my passions
    and goals because of money.  I need help.  If I could have help
    covering rent and bills for the next 2 months, I could get my henna
    business off the ground, and start sustaining, without having to say
    no to the amazing opportunity at Anishanabe Academy. In turn, I
    could save for a downpayment on a house, and move my mom in with me.
     You have no idea how life changing this would be.  Thank you thank
    you thank you for considering.",https://fundrazr.com/21Gjye

  things to do was to go to public markets.  There, I had the pleasure
  of meeting nice people of various walks of life.  The majority of
  these people were generous, friendly and honest in spite of the fact
  that many of them clearly were rather poor and struggling financially.
   Items that the merchants sold to provide for their families included
  beautiful handcrafts.  Obviously, I always ended up buying a few items
  that I brought back home with me.  From time to time, I get comments
  from friends asking where they can purchase such items and I end up
  disappointing them by telling them that they were from so and so
  country and to either wait until I go back there or that they can
  travel there themselves in order to buy them. I always wanted to help others and also to have my own business.  A
  year and a half ago, I found myself without a job due to the collapse
  of the Oil&Gas industry .  Around that same time, I found out that
  my younger brother was diagnosed with lung cancer.  The devastating
  news made me decided to take time off to be with him and his family (a
  wife and 4 young kids).  On August 4th, 2017 my brother died at the
  age of 50; the same date and age as when my father died.  Taking all
  of this into consideration and knowing that the likelihood of one
  finding a suitable job when one is in his/her fifties, I decided to
  start Berichco LLC to be there for my brother's family and to help
  many other struggling families by helping them sell their hand made
  products in North America. I count on you to help me launch Berichco LLC organization.  As a

  Gourmet Nuts Confections which are hand made primarily from high end
  nuts.  Not only they taste great and are healthy, but they are also

200,Help Us Become Certified USDA Organic and More!,Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,,,3,"Hello! My name is Alex Dupler, I'm one of the founding members of WestWood Organics . Between
  diabetes, obesity, and a whole slew of other diseases, Americans have
  experienced deteriorating health and are falling behind the citizens
  of many other countries. While we recognize there are a myriad of
  causes behind this unfortunate phenomenon, the primary factor is diet.
  Americans as a whole are consuming artificial ingredients like
  high-fructose corn syrup and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
  that negatively affect every aspect of health, but it's not their
  fault! The companies that make these ingredients want to keep people
  in the dark about them, and on top of that, there just aren't a lot of
  organic options for people looking to test it out or make a lifestyle change. Now that you have some background of the problem we are trying to
  tackle, let me tell you our story: During the summer of 2017, my good friend and our founder, Luke West
  ( West ), began making sodas for his own personal
  health. The sodas are unique in the sense that they are created via
  fermentation, the same process kombuchas go through. Kombuchas are a
  popular health-food item that can be found at large supermarkets like
  Kroger, but they haven't infiltrated past health enthusiasts into the
  homes of mainstream America due to their off-putting, vinegar-laden
  flavor. The fermentation process works by supporting a healthy
  bacteria culture within a fruit-based (i.e. raspberry) or root-based
  (i.e. ginger) organic tea. As the process plays out, the healthy
  bacteria packs the sodas with beneficial acids and probiotics that aid
  gut function and give you energy. After Luke started making the sodas
  for himself, he showed our friend Andrew Garwood
  ( Wood ) how to make them and over time, they perfected
  the recipe to the point where the sodas maintained a fantastic, fruity
  flavor all while providing the same health benefits of a kombucha. At
  that point, they realized the sodas filled a market need and could
  also serve a higher purpose to change people's health one small step
  at a time and named their passion WestWood Organics. Looking to
  expand, Luke reached out to his younger brother Chris, myself, and our
  friends Bret Sagasser and Riley VanderKaay. All of us graduated from
  the same high school except Chris, who is in the 11th grade. Riley and
  I are students at Ohio State University, Bret is a student at the
  University of Cincinnati, and Luke and Andrew have taken time off to
  put sweat equity into WestWood Organics. We are currently located in less than 5 independent grocery stores in
  Ohio. Before we expand to bigger independent grocery stores and,
  eventually, larger chains, there is a lot of legal red-tape we have to
  cut through. We have already jumped through many legal hoops between
  becoming an LLC, joining the GS1 barcode association, insuring our
  sodas, and securing a certified kitchen to produce them in, but there
  are still a few things we need to do. First of all, in order to stand
  our ground we must become certified USDA Organic. Beyond that, we have
  to have a laboratory test our drinks to confirm shelf life and
  determine nutrition facts such as calories and macronutrients. We have
  combined our own money along with the revenue generated by supplying a
  few small grocers to help pay for these expenses, but we need your
  help to make it a reality! If you are willing to contribute in any
  way, for any reason, anything helps! Thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/westwoodorganics

    in October and friends for 6 years. Michael has worked since he was
    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but numerous side jobs. He was a mechanic and
    painter a nd his main career was for 30+years as a
    Manager and District Manager in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the

"53,835",Support Legalizing Psychedelic Medicine,Business,Canadian Dollar,,of $50k goal,,,279,"In the early 1950s, psychedelic drugs were considered promising
  treatments for a broad range of psychological and psychiatric
  conditions. For political reasons, their legal use for healing
  purposes was halted in the 1960s. MDMA was first made in 1912 and was used to improve psychotherapy
      in the 1970's. Both the non-medical and therapeutic use of MDMA
      were made illegal in 1985. Currently, one in six North Americans will suffer from PTSD in their lifetime. PTSD is highly correlated with depression, addiction, and suicide. According to a study published in the CNS Neuroscience &
      Therapeutics Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a
      global health issue, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3% to 37.4%. 58 veterans committed suicide after their service
      in the Afghan War; many of them had PTSD. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry determined that roughly 271,000 Vietnam vets still have full war-zone-related
      PTSD that meets some diagnostic criteria 40 years after
      the war. While there are various treatments available to those suffering from
  PTSD and related illnesses, the recovery rates and effectiveness of
  current treatments are low. With your help, we can change these alarming statistics and
    help legalize psychedelic medicine. MAPS Canada is in the process of conducting research investigating
  the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of
  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with full approval and
  involvement from Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA). MDMA-assisted psychotherapy combines talk therapy with the use of
  MDMA, (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) a synthetic compound that
  enhances the effectiveness of the psychotherapy by helping patients
  feel more comfortable discussing difficult memories and emotions. In a recently published study, 83% of subjects receiving
  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer qualified for PTSD, and everyone
  who received a placebo and then went on to receive MDMA-assisted
  psychotherapy experienced significant and lasting improvements. The long-term follow-up of subjects receiving MDMA-assisted
  psychotherapy revealed that on average overall benefits were
  maintained for 3½ years or more. Our Swiss study published in 2013
  also found clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms after
  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Independent medical research studies would not be possible without a
  community of supporters like yourself. By making a contribution and sharing this campaign, you will help to

  research studies is costly and would not be possible without a

250,Broken Stick Brewing Company,Business,Canadian Dollar,"Dec 31, 2018",of $150k goal,,,6,"Broken Stick Brewing Company Broken Stick Brewing Company is a small craft brewery located in
    Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was established in 2014.  Since we opened we've proven
    ourselves to be a successful brewery. We're know of our quirky beer names ie (Crazy Ivan, Socks and
    Sandals IPA, RIIDIPA, Downtown Leroy Brown Porter,...). We're looking to upgrade our small 3bbl system to a large 15bbl What does this mean? It means we have such a high demand for our
    award winning beers that we need to produce more to meet those
    demands. Our old Mash Tun tank Our
  old Fermentation Tank To fix the space we are relocating the
  brewery to a new location so that we can purchase larger equipment and
  put in a tasting room and host various events throughout the year. We need new tanks that we can meet the demand of the beers
    flying off our shelves. The new equipment we are looking to purchase wit the help of fundrazr. Mash Tun 15BBL ( 5 Times larger than our original ) New Fermentation tanks and to upgrade from growlers to cans.  People want cans and we
    want to bring cans to the masses. This also helps us get into
    regulatory outlets such as the L.C.B.O in Ontario and other private
    vendors across Canada & The US. Currently we use Keg's to fill up the growlers and once the
    growlers are poured we begin to lose carbonation and the beers
    eventually go flat. This doesn't seem to happen to us but we cant
    get into the regulatory stores without cans unfortunately. We want to bring new and exciting recipes to the great people
    of Ottawa and beyond.  Think flavorful IPAs and double IPAs, spicy
    Saisons, Chocolaty Imperial Stouts, fruity Sours and balanced
    sessions. We're looking for your donations to make all this possible.  You
    won't just be helping us in this endeavor, you'll be helping the
    taste buds of all the beer lovers just like you. Keep it crafty friends and continue pushing boundaries. Rewards ? We want to offer those who donate a thank you gift for helping

"1,192",Joan Gadsby Legal Action Fund Fighting for Justice,Business,Canadian Dollar,,of $125k goal,,,6,"I NEED YOUR HELP ! 5 DECADE LONG SUCCESSFUL WOMAN EXECUTIVE FINANCIALLY
    DEVASTATED AND FORCED OUT OF MY FAMILY HOME OF 43 YEARS WHO AM I ? My name is Joan Gadsby and I live in North Vancouver,British
    Columbia Canada and grew up in Southern Ontario. MY BACKGROUND I was in the top 2% of Canadian income earners most of my 5
    decade long successful career in the corporate world working as a
    senior marketing ,strategic planning and property development
    executive with four of Canada's largest companies,as a former
    excluded senior level executive in the BC government and a
    successful entrepreneur running 2 of my own companies, my multi
    family oceanview development Seaview Villa Estates on the Sunshine
    Coast in British Columbia www.seaviewvillaestates.com and my consulting
    company, Market Media International Corporation. I also was a former
    poll topping non partisan North Vancouver District Councillor for 13
    years,part of my extensive years of community service work. Author of an internationally endorsed book ""Addiction By
    Prescription"" - One Woman's Triumph and Fight for Change
    published in 2000 ,I was also Co Executive Producer of a television
    documentary ""Our Pill Epidemic""- the Shocking Story of a
    Society Hooked on Drugs which has aired internationally and
    nationally since 1998. www.addictionbyprescription.com I wrote my awareness driven book, which was one of the
    biggest hits at the Frankfurt Germany Book Fair when it was first
    published, after almost dying February 1,1990 from an unintentional
    overdose of tranquilizers and sleeping pills wrongfully prescribed
    for 18 years by my former trusted family doctor following the death
    of my 4 year old son with a brain tumour.Thank God I survived and
    have been off all those insidious drugs now for 26 years. The continued overprescribing and misprescribing of these
    drugs creates ""accidental addicts "" and remains as a world
    wide systemic problem inspite of my years of work ,extensive
    worlwide research and international speaking engagements in this field. Rebuilding my health,my career and my family cost me
    $2million in lost income and assets in the 1990s following my
    horrendous experience with prescription drugs. Throughout my working career and lifetime I have always been
    committed to being a good Mom, making a good living and making the
    world a better place. At no time going through the past 8 years of hell since the
    global financial crisis and economic meltdown of 2008 have I
    sacrificed the values I was raised with as a child.Nor have I
    compromised my integrity. I have always worked in a ""man's world achieving many
    firsts as a woman after graduating from Western University,London
    Ontario in the 1960s and after being one of the first women in the
    MBA program at the University of British Columbia and being awarded
    a scholarship for the highest marks. I was also nominated as one of Canada's most notable women by
    the Canadian University Women's Club in the 1990s. FINANCIAL DEVASTATION WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY DO I NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT ? Prior to the well recognized global financial crisis and
    economic meltdown of 2008, acknowledged as the worst recession since
    the Great Depression, which I did not create nor could I control, I
    had personally built through years of hard work,perseverance and
    determination , $5.5 million in assets including my North Vancouver
    4 bedroom home in Upper Capilano Highlands on an estate size treed
    and view property where I lived and raised my children, my wealth
    rebuilding project after prescription drugs,my Seaview development
    on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast and the contemporary high end
    show home built as part of Seaview's successful phase 1 of 8
    townhomes built and sold at Seaview's site in 2007. Since 2008 I have gone through 8 years of hell with
    everything I have worked so hard for all my life being seriously
    impacted and challenged including my ongoing income,my well planned
    financial security and financial planning for retirement,my
    lifestyle and sense of well being and my strong belief in social and
    economic justice and human rights here at home in Canada where I was born. My losses and damages since 2008 exceed $6million. All 3 of my properties were foreclosed on and lost through
    the highly dysfunctional British Columbia Court system created by
    ""old boys"" for ""old boys"" after I had fully paid
    back the Royal Bank ,Seaview's phase 1 financing partner its
    $2,588,000 loan from Seaview's phase 1 revenue of $3,362,000 in 2007. Canadian Banks,including the Royal Bank received $114 billion
    in ""bailouts"" through the Canadian government with
    taxpayers' money between 2008 and 2010 since the Banks were
    reportedly ""underwater"" in part to provide continuity in
    financing to successful business people such as myself through
    extreme difficulties associated with accessing capital as a direct
    result of the financial crisis. However,inspite of having paid hundreds of thousands of
    dollars in taxes to the Canadian government throughout my career and
    having created 400 jobs with Seaview's phase 1 which I could do so
    again and could stimulate the economy with each of Seaview's
    remaining 3 planned phases,financing was not available to move
    Seaview forward even though Bank executives referred to my Seaview
    oceanview development as being ""stunning."" I was ""hung out to dry"" and discriminated against
    by the Canadian government who took care of the Banks and their
    executives with my only alternative to take out a mortgage from a
    North Vancouver private secondary lender based on my high equity in
    my home appraised at $1,325,000 which I was reluctant to do to
    invest in Seaview to keep the project moving forward with the
    expectation that the financial crisis would hopefully soon be resolved. The result - the traumatic and ""soul destroying ""
    experience of being forced out of my secure and safe refuge,my home
    of 43 years on April 12,2013 sold to a ""lowball,vulture buyer
    at $876,000 and ""flipped"" 6 weeks later to another buyer
    at $1.1 million.I received no money. Similarly ,in August 2015, the remaining land for Seaview's
    planned next 3 phases of 40 condos was sold to another ""low
    ball, vulture"" buyer for $550,000 compared to the appraised
    market value of the 95% serviced land alone at $1,876,000 and
    appraisal of $3,761,000 for the project as a whole. In approving the lowball sale,the BC Supreme Court Judge
    referred to me as a highly sophisticated business woman and
    flippantly stated that I could rebuild my wealth. An incredible comment given that I was 75 years of age at the time. As Seaview's sole shareholder my investment in Seaview to
    December 31,2014 was $3,026,000 with projected revenue of $18 to $20
    million and projected profit of $6.1 million. My financial survival , future income and livelihood were all
    dependent on completing my Seaview development. All 3 of my properties were lost through the well recognized
    highly dysyfunctional and antiquated court system which ignored (a)
    the deleterious and continuing effects of the global financial
    crisis caused by the greed and dishonesty of financial institutions
    involved with the sub prime mortgage market (reflected in 2 recent
    feature films ""The Wolf of Wall Street "" and ""The Big
    Short "",(b)my allegations of fraud and collusion among
    realtors,lawyers and appraisal companies working for and with ""
    lowball,vulture"" buyers of my home and issues of social and
    economic justice and human rights. WHAT WILL FUNDS RAISED BE USED FOR ? Donations will be used to assist with legal costs for complex
    litigation regarding the forced sale of my home challenging
    fairness,openness, transparency and access to justice enshrined in
    the Canadian Bill of Rights- An Act for the Recognition and
    Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1960 and
    enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 1982 with
    particular reference to ""without discrimination"",'the
    right of the individual to life,liberty,security of the person and
    enjoyment of property"",the right of the individual to equality
    before the law and the protection of the law. "" In addition to naming the Canadian Government and the British
    Government as defendants ,my Notice of Civil Claim includes the
    secondary lender who provided a $174,000 mortgage on my home, its
    lawyer,the private contractor for the BC Government who hired the
    movers who trashed and lost my furnishings and accessories,the
    realtors and appraisal company involved and the agent for and the
    ""vulture"" buyer of my home who ""flipped"" my home
    in 6 weeks. My claim includes discrimination, failure of duty of care,
    negligence,alleged fraud and collusion with over $1million in
    damages for loss of equity, damaged and lost furniture,punitive
    damages,special costs and extraordinary costs for reprehensible
    conduct,cruelty, abuse,psychological and emotional trauma. As a result of the high costs of lawyers and of financial
    necessity,I became a self represented litigant in Court for 4 years
    to try and protect my hard earned interests regarding my home and my
    Seaview development .I was described by Judges and Masters as
    ""a person of integrity,hard working and conscientious and not
    ""a shrinking violet."" I have been looking for an experienced and dedicated lawyer
    and law firm to work closely with me on this litigation who is
    knowledgeable of legal principles involved, can research relevant
    case law and provide advice on procedures and if funds are available
    through this fund raising campaign to represent me in Court. TIMEFRAME My civil claim for my home which is my highest priority is
    85% completed in draft format and is required to be filed by October 31st,2016. The filing of my Notice of Claim re my Seaview development
    with damages and losses of in excess of 5million is targetted for
    filing by May 1,2017. WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ? I am sincerely and earnestly requesting your financial
    support in my fight for justice and to right a serious wrong which
    has left me financially devastated in all respects through no fault
    of mine nor of bad business decisions I have made. Favourable Court decisions in my litigation can become
    precedent and landmark setting and can help others who have not ,

Until then, they will incur out-of-pocket medical expenses and deductibles, plus normal living expenses.  The transplant is mostly covered, but as with most insurance, there are many unknowns.

  at the collapse of the World Trade Center and the crash of flight 587
  the same year, resulting in significant and severe respiratory injuries and
  post-traumatic stress disorder. Even as a civilian ,During Hurricane Sandy, Christopher helped
  rescue others trapped in homes by floodwater escape to safety ahead of
  a massive fire that destroyed a significant portion of his
  neighborhood in the rockaways  . (His own home was severely damaged at that time as well) Most recently, with the knowledge that lung diseases caused by his service with the
  FDNY were becoming more debilitating, he decided to attempt a last life-long dream of driving the
  Pan-American Highway to the tip of South America before returning to
  the US for required treatment. Unfortunately, his trip was cut short when a hurricane passed through
  Central America that destroyed roads and bridges to the north and
  south of him . Essentially trapping him  until infrastructure could be
  temporarily repaired . While attempting to assist others recover from the damage of  this
  storm , Christopher became critically ill,collapsed and was hospitalized
  several times in Costa Rica. He was Initially being treated for fungal and bacterial pneumonia, but further testing revealed that his lung disease had progressed
  much more aggressively than had been anticipated. and due to  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He most likely will be in
  need of a lung transplant in the near future. Upon release from
  the hospital, due to lack of financial means to continue paying for
  further treatment, Christopher was attempting to return through Costa Rica to the United States, but was stopped at the border by customs officials who confiscated
  his truck and possessions because he had overstayed his tourist
  temporary import visa by  only two days. He should have been granted a medical waiver, as is Costa Rican law, but the corrupt officials saw his rapidly failing health as an
  opportunity to steal his property in hopes that he would not be well
  enough, or around long enough, to go before a judge and get this
  miscarriage of justice overturned. Basically, he was left stranded with his service dog without enough
  money,  his  essential medical supplies , prescriptions, his clothing
  and most imperatively, a method to drive themselves home. While the law is on his side in terms of getting his truck back,
  legal expenses and red tape are delaying its return and his ability to
  come home to New York City. Christopher’s PTSD is a direct result  from witnessing and working
  multiple major airline accidents. Due to this ,it makes it extremely difficult  for him  to fly .
  especially  under these current enormously stressful and life
  threatening circumstances. We are trying to raise money to help
  bring him home to get on a waiting list for a lung transplant By
  helping to cover past and present medical , Legal and travel expenses. Fortunately, due to Christopher’s service and sacrifice while
  employed as a New York City firefighter, All future potentially life-saving treatment should be mostly
  covered under the umbrella of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. We just need to get him here as as quickly as possible. It’s imperative that we raise enough money to achieve that goal immediately. Please do all you can to help us get my brother home. He needs and deserves to be in the comfort of family and friends as

645,Help me help others thrive through Ayurveda!,Health,Pound Sterling,"Feb 9, 2018",of £3.5k goal,,,17,"Help Me Activate Innate Wellness Potential Do you feel somewhat (or more significantly) off, or out of
  sync? Is your current lifestyle taking a toll on your sleep,
  energy, or diet, but you don't know how to resolve this?  Or maybe
  you've plateaued, but know that there's always room for improvement,
  and aren't sure what to do... We're in the age of information overwhelm and are regularly bombarded
  with advice on what we should and shouldn't be doing to be healthy. On
  top of figuring out what to do amidst all the information
  clutter, change can be HARD. But I can show you what changes to make to dramatically uplevel
    your health AND make it EASY & FUN through wisdom from Ayurveda
    &the science of habit change. You can help me do this with your donation. It's become increasingly apparent to me that individual and
    collective mind-body-spirit integrity is necessaryfor catalyzing
    positive social change in the world. That's what I've come to
  appreciate after years of involvement in, and study of, environmental
  and social justice movements, and I hope you can help me! My Story ​ I thought I had a fairly healthy lifestyle - I cycled everywhere, ate
  'healthily', etc.  Still, I didn't feel as well as one might expect I
  should feel with that lifestyle. And despite my seemingly healthy life, I developed an arrhythmia,
      out of nowhere. Thankfully, the doctors stated it was a 'non-worrisome' kind, as far
  as arrhythmias go, but anyone who has routinely experienced their
  heart skipping beats and then pounding on and off throughout the day
  knows it's not pleasant. The cardiologist and my GP didn't couldn't
  shed any light on why this was happening, how to stop it, and simply
  told me that I could take anti-anxiety meds if the arrhythmia itself
  was distressing me. I tried various things (working out, meditation, herbs, acupuncture),
  and they all certainly benefited me in various ways but didn't resolve
  my arrhythmia. I was still lacking the set of simple, foundational
  elements for well being. At some point, I started exploring Ayurveda, an ancient wellness
  tradition of India, where my ancestors hail from. There were aspects
  of it that I grew up with but had lost touch with, and other aspects
  that were new to me. But even after learning this, changing my
    lifestyle accordingly proved impossible until I tried combining core
    elements of Ayurvedic self-care with applied behavioral science. This is the missing piece that seemed to recalibrate me, and I
    can't remember the last time I've experienced arrhythmia, something
    that had plagued me for five years. The amazing thing is that I
    wasn't even trying to sort out my heart condition - I had tried for
    five years and had accepted that it was something I had to live
    with. And that's often what happens when people live more in
    alignment with natural rhythms - issues like excess weight resolve
    themselves without specifically working on them. What is Ayurveda & how can it help you? Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term that literally means 'science of 
    life', but has also been translated as 'the art of living' and 'the
    science of longevity'. Aspects, particular from the food
  side of it, are becoming increasingly trendy e.g. ghee, turmeric
  everything, etc.  But what it really comes down to, and in this sense has in common
    with other traditions, is living in alignment with the natural order/natural law/rhythms
    of nature, rather than against it. And it's this alignment
  that is just as important as diet, exercise, etc.  We can be eating
  well and be relatively fit but still have habits that sabotage our
  innate restorative capacity and/or generate a kind of debris that
  clogs our mind-body-spirit landscape. The impacts will manifest at
  different times and different ways depending on our individual
  make-up. Interestingly,there are now a number of biomedical studies
  showing the adverse effects of violating natural cycles. Moreover, our habits will shape our health in the next 10, 20, 30+
  years, and if you're reading this, it's not too early or too late for
  you to adopt life-affirming ones. If you want to preserve your
    mind-body-spirit for the duration of your time here on earth - to
    serve as best you can for as long as possible - isn't it worth
    putting the effort in to establish these habits now? Results All kinds of people can benefit from incorporating these
      daily routines - from people who may have a poor diet and inactive
      lifestyle to those at the other end of the
  spectrum. Fortunately, we are incredibly resilient,
  and continuous small changes can have dramatic results. The results
  for people who have successfully incorporated these habits into their
  lives include: - being naturally energized and no longer dependent on caffeine -more rejuvenating rest -more focus throughout day -losing excess weight without trying -freeing up time/having more time in schedule -being able to parent calmly and effectively -having more rewarding time with spouse and children -being more focused and efficient in home and work life -more trust in intuition around eating -skill in facilitating family members, including children,
        to begin integrating these routines Disclaimer Applying Ayurvedic principles should help everyone, regardless
    of age or health status, but is not a replacement for seeking care
    from a licensed healthcare professional for any medical conditions
    you may have. About the Funding While I've personally had success with this, I want to be able to
  guarantee results for people in all kinds of situations and circumstances. As with many things, the results come quicker and easier
      through weekly coaching over a period of time. T hat's why I'd like to train as a coach, and the funding
      from generous donors would go toward that training and help to
      develop the platform and content for the coaching. If successful, I will be imparting the tools for people to actualize
  this through various means: interactive online webcasts, different
  extents of coaching ( More Info Re: Special Rate 3-Month
  Coaching ) , and free & low-cost workshops locally

"8,211",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,Health,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,,,77,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

    M.D. who specializes in complex illness and an extensive stay at a

420,MKSpeech: speech based notetaker for the blind,Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,,,5,"English version Introduction Thanks to the improvements in the technology over the last decades it
  is perfectly possible that a blind person can interact with software
  and hardware as any other person does. However, there are some
  situations where a computer is not suitable for everyone, especially
  those who are studying or working, and need a portable device with a
  high battery capacity which could be accessed as fast as possible.
  Some companies created those devices, called notetaker. Basically a
  notetaker is a PDA which allows blind people to take notes everywhere,
  both in a QWERTY or Braille keyboard, and adds a set of customized
  applications for their needs. Notetakers are eazy to use and its
  interface is designed to be easy to understand and access, while
  keeping all functionality that may be useful to a blind person. These
  devices have been used successfully during the last 20 years,
  approximately. However, there is a big problem for most blind
  individuals. These devices are being sold at prohibitive prices,
  starting from $900 up to, approximately, $4000 USD Dollars per device
  or even more, depending on the implemented features. This is the main
  reason why notetakers can only be used in countries where people can
  buy them thanks to governmental support or some other organisations,
  excluding the majority of the blind individuals who don’t have this
  kind of support available in their countries. MKSpeech will be a
  speech powered Note Taker aimed at blind people. The device will be
  built on the top of open source software operating systems, libraries
  and text to speech engines, but will provide support for some
  commercial products too if it can improve the user experience. The
  device will communicate with the user through a text to speech engine,
  that is, a piece of software capable of converting text to speech, and
  the input will be done through a braille or QWERTY keyboard, so it
  will be easy, fast and comfortable for everyone. Who am I? My name is Manuel Cortez, I am a blind software developer from
  Mexico. I have been blind since I was 14, and I have been coding since
  2012 and using Linux since 2009. In 2014, I created TWBlue, an accessible and open source Twitter
  client application; in 2015 I developed two audiogames, Town of peril and Undead Assault (games that rely only on audio,
  aimed at blind people). These projects are available for everyone
  completely free of charge. When I became blind, I noticed that there
  are lots of useful devices aimed at the blind, but unfortunately these
  devices aren't affordable for the majority of the blind people in the
  world due to their prices. With the current technology, I think blind
  people shouldn’t have to pay excessive prices for the same technology
  that everyone else is using every day. I have decided to create
  MKSpeech because I had the opportunity to know how a notetaker works,
  but 90% of the blind people in Mexico, or every other country in Latin
  America, don’t. My goal is that everyone will have the same rights and
  access to the same technology. I think that blind people should be
  able to enjoy the flexibility of these kinds of devices without
  needing to pay more than 500, or even 300, USD dollars. And I think
  the only way to go is open source. Why another notetaker? Price: This device will be sold at $300 or even less, if possible. Language support: It will be possible to translate the notetaker’s
    applications to all available languages by using open source
    software and technology. Updates and support: While I am planning to update and support my
    own software, the base operating system will be Debian GNU/Linux
    (Raspbian) and users will receive system updates and other
    application improvements for years, completely free of charge. When
    released, there will be different channels for getting technical support. Open source: I will write the required software for getting an
    accessible notetaker and will release the source code as open source software. Hardware: The notetaker will be based on the Raspberry Pi Model 3b
    and some additional hardware that is going to be developed for the project. The money will be used for developing the following projects around
  the device: A braille and QWERTY keyboard that will be connected to the PI. A battery that will be powering the entire device, and a module
    that will connect the battery with the Raspberry Pi so it will be
    possible to control the attached battery with a switch, and will be
    possible to get the battery status and get notifications when low
    power from the device. A mini speaker so it will be able to play sound and speech without
    having to use headphones. Every device will integrate a Raspberry Pi model 3B, a micro SD
    card with 16, 32 or 64 GB of storage, and a soundcard that includes
    a built in microphone. I will improve some of the existent open source components in
    order to provide a better user experience, and these improvements
    will be given back to the community. The following accessible applications will be developed for the
    project: A note taking module, contacts manager, File manager, audio
    recorder, ebook reader, audio and video player, interfaces for
    managing different settings in the device, and a system menu. A manual for using the device will be written and included in a
    digital copy and optionally in Braille. You can find more information in the MKSpeech's website . Versión en español Introducción Gracias a los avances en la tecnología durante las últimas décadas es
  perfectamente posible que una persona con discapacidad visual pueda
  interactuar con software y hardware de forma completamente normal. Sin
  embargo, existen algunas situaciones en las que un ordenador no es la
  opción ideal para todos, especialmente aquellos que estudian o
  trabajan, y requieren de un dispositivo portátil con una batería de
  larga duración al que puedan acceder lo más rápido posible. Algunas
  compañías crearon este tipo de dispositivos, llamados anotadores.
  Básicamente un anotador es un PDA (agenda digital portátil) que
  permite a las personas ciegas tomar notas en todo lugar, utilizando un
  teclado QWERTY o Braille, e incluye un grupo de aplicaciones
  especialmente diseñadas para cubrir sus necesidades. Los anotadores
  son fáciles de usar y sus interfaces han sido creadas para ser
  sencillas de entender y acceder, mientras mantienen toda la
  funcionalidad que puede ser útil para una persona ciega. Esta clase de
  dispositivos ha sido aceptada ampliamente durante los últimos 20 años, aproximadamente. Sin embargo, hay un gran problema para la mayoría de las
  personas ciegas. Esta clase de dispositivos se venden a precios
  prohibitivos, iniciando desde los 900 dólares estadounidenses hasta,
  aproximadamente, los 4000 o más, dependiendo de sus características.
  Esta es la razón principal por la que los anotadores solo pueden ser
  utilizados en países en los que las personas ciegas pueden comprarlos
  gracias a apoyos gubernamentales o provenientes de otras
  organizaciones, excluyendo a la mayoría de la población de personas
  ciegas que no cuentan con esta clase de beneficios. MKSpeech será un anotador dirigido a las personas ciegas. El
  dispositivo será construido sobre librerías, motores de texto a voz y
  sistemas operativos de código abierto, pero se proporcionará soporte a
  productos no libres y comerciales, con la finalidad de mejorar la
  experiencia de usuario. El dispositivo se comunicará con el usuario
  mediante un motor de texto a voz, esto es, una tecnología capaz de
  recoger texto y convertirlo en una representación hablada, y la
  entrada de información se realizará a través de un teclado (Braille o
  QWERTY), lo que será fácil, rápido y cómodo tanto para la gente que ha
  aprendido Braille como para quien se sienta más cómodo con un teclado
  de ordenador. ¿Quién soy yo? Mi nombre es Manuel cortéz, y soy un desarrollador de software ciego
  nacido en México. Tengo ceguera desde los 14 años, y he estado
  programando desde 2012 y usando Linux y derivados desde 2009. En el
  año 2014, he creado TWBlue, un cliente de twitter accesible y de código
  abierto; en 2015 he desarrollado dos audiojuegos, Town of Peril y Undead Assault (juegos que solo están basados en
  audio, destinados también a personas ciegas). Estos proyectos se
  encuentran disponibles para todo el mundo de forma completamente
  gratuita. Cuando perdí la vista, me di cuenta que existen muchos
  dispositivos útiles destinados a hacer la vida de las personas ciegas
  mucho más fácil, pero desafortunadamente la mayoría de ellos no es
  asequible debido a sus muy altos precios. Con la tecnología con la que
  contamos en la actualidad, creo que las personas ciegas no deberían
  pagar mucho más por usar la misma clase de tecnología que el resto del
  mundo está utilizando ya. He decidido crear MKSpeech porque yo he
  tenido la oportunidad de conocer cómo funciona un anotador, pero la
  mayoría de las personas ciegas en México, o incluso en muchos otros
  países dentro de américa latina, no. Mi objetivo es que todo el mundo
  tenga los mismos derechos y pueda acceder a la misma tecnología. Creo
  que las personas ciegas deberían poder disfrutar de la flexibilidad
  que este tipo de dispositivos ofrece sin la necesidad de pagar más de
  500, o incluso 300, dólares estadounidenses. Y creo que la única forma
  de lograrlo es a través de software de código abierto. ¿Por qué otro anotador? Precio: este dispositivo se venderá a 300 dólares, incluso menos,
    si es posible. Soporte de idiomas: será posible traducir la interfaz del anotador
    a todo los idiomas que se desee utilizando tecnologías de código
    abierto y estándares de traducción en el software. Actualizaciones: Mientras que planeo mantener actualizadas todas
    las aplicaciones que desarrollaré para este proyecto, el sistema
    operativo principal será Debian GNU/Linux (Raspbian) y los usuarios
    recibirán actualizaciones del sistema operativo y otras aplicaciones
    incluidas por muchos años, de forma completamente gratuita. Cuando
    el dispositivo salga a la venta, se proporcionarán diversos medios
    para solicitar soporte técnico. Código abierto: Escribiré el software que todavía se necesita para
    conseguir un anotador parlante, y lo liberaré bajo código abierto
    para que la comunidad pueda emplearlo de otras maneras, así como
    estudiarlo y mejorarlo. Hardware: el anotador será desarrollado tomando como base una
    Raspberry Pi model 3, y nuevo hardware se diseñará específicamente
    para el dispositivo. Los fondos recaudados se emplearán para desarrollar los siguientes proyectos: Un teclado braille y otro QWERTY, que se podrán conectar al anotador. Una batería para proporcionar energía al dispositivo, y un módulo
    que facilitará la conexión de dicha batería con la Raspberry Pi, lo
    que permitirá controlar la batería con un interruptor, y recibir
    notificaciones cuando hay poca batería en el dispositivo. Un altavoz, lo que permitirá utilizar el dispositivo sin la
    necesidad de utilizar auriculares. Cada dispositivo incluirá una Raspberry Pi Model 3, una tarjeta
    Micro SD de 16, 32 o 64 GB y una tarjeta de sonido que incluye un
    micrófono integrado. Se mejorarán algunas herramientas de código abierto ya existentes
    a fin de mejorar la experiencia de usuarios de lectores de pantalla,
    y dichas mejoras se liberarán a toda la comunidad. Las siguientes aplicaciones accesibles se desarrollarán para el
    proyecto: un módulo para tomar notas, administrador de contactos,
    gestor de archivos, grabador de audio, lector de libros, reproductor
    de video y música, interfaces para configurar el dispositivo, y un
    menú principal para el sistema. Un manual para utilizar el dispositivo se escribirá en versión
    digital y -opcionalmente, en Braille. Puedes encontrar más información en la página
    web de MKSpeech. Recompensas Cuando realizas un donativo de cierta cantidad, puedes acceder a una

350,Le Pain D' Peace,Business,,,,,,,"Hello world! My name is Danny, I'm looking to get funding to start a
  clothing company called Le Pain D' Peace. I'm doing this with my wife Melina. The idea of the name came to me on my way to work, not liking what I
  was doing, feeling stuck in one place with no progression in sight,
  living from paycheck to paycheck. I had that impression of going
  nowhere, a feeling emptiness. With a backache in bonus from hurting
  myself at work. But I have a family to feed and the bills keeps on coming! The image that came to my head is the gingerbread man, as the tale
  goes, with my own interpretation, he did not accept his condition,
  coming out the oven stay there waiting to be eaten like the other
  biscuits he was cooked with. So he ran away, ran as fast as he could.
  Most of us knows the rest of the story, so no need for now to go with
  all the details. What hit me was that in French, my first language, gingerbread is
  called ""Pain d'épices"" - literally ""spicy bread"" .
  Pain means bread, and pain was what I was feeling at that time, both
  mentally and physically!  For ""d'épices"" it's pronounced -
  (d) A pēs - . So the word peace was what came to my mind and
    peace is exactly what I needed. The slogan that came to my mind was
    ""Life is Pain (D: will get to talk about that letter later on)
    and Peace! So that's pretty much all what the inspiration is! Then I have worked on a logo with a friend with I'm really proud of! The story continues...",https://fundrazr.com/11CxI6

  to those who need them most. For that purpose ill setup a website - i
  already bought the domain - http://trumot.online where kids

  the shipment fee(around 60$ to the furthest locations like australia
  and the us - but the pc is for free!! of course ill try to ship for free if it is not possible for that
  person to pay the fee, and hopefully that will incourge others like me
  who just want to help, to do the same... just so u get an idea of where the money will be spent - here is a
  sample of a sale in ebay - http://ebay.to/2ns066H for  30
  laptops for the price of 470$ with shipping, (about 15.6 $ per

110,Please kickstart Borneo agro-ecological research,Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $35k goal,,,4,"I'm Dr. Lenard Milich , and I'm the advisor for the
  Central Kalimantan Agro-Ecology Research Center at Bogor Agricultural University . I
  want to introduce you to an amazing and threatened forest in Central
  Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) that harbors the highest density of
  orang utans found in all of Borneo. I first entered the peat forests
  of Central Kalimantan as the team leader of the socio-economic impact assessment of a large sustainable development- forest conservation pilot project
  in Indonesia. One of the local people in the communities we visited
  told me that a bunch of orang utans lived across the river from his
  village. Later that year, during school vacation, I returned to that
  village with my 8-year old daughter, to see if we could see wild orang
  utans - which we did, as you can see from the photo on this fundraiser. It turns out that this little scrap of disturbed tropical peat swamp
  forest  - just 200 ha (500 acres) in size - contains the highest
  density of orang utans in all Borneo (the Curator of Primates at the
  Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, DC studied this patch for
  her doctoral dissertation research – I can provide the reference to
  anyone interested). This high density is most assuredly due to the
  fact that the forest is a remnant of a once larger tract and has
  become a refuge for these animals from the devastation of their
  habitat by oil palm plantations. And although we know a lot about the
  behavior of wild orang utans, we don't know how to get them (and other
  endangered or threatened Bornean animals, such as proboscis monkeys,
  sun bears, clouded leopards, and pangolins) to move from one forest
  patch to another. What kind of corridors do we need to create to help
  them move between forest islands? How do we stop them from eating the
  fruit off the trees local people planted? How do we prevent them from
  stripping the bark off the rubber trees (thus killing them) on which
  the local Dayak people depend for income when, during the dry season
  when fruit are scarce, the rubber trees' inner bark (the cambium)
  offers one of only a few sources of food? Human-wildlife conflicts are
  all too common here, as elsewhere in the world, and it is always the
  wildlife that pay the price. This challenge of finding ways to both accommodate human
  socioeconomic needs while protecting wild nature and ecosystem
  processes that support human societies has been called the
  ""conservation divide."" If we want to make sure that nature
  continues providing for people's livelihoods and well-being, we must
  keep ecosystem processes intact. At the same time, many of us wish to
  preserve nature for nature's sake - that is, keep animals in a
  benevolent Eden. Unfortunately, too often these are incompatible
  goals. Bridging this divide is the new
  frontier in conservation, and it's the central focus of this proposed
  research center. We at Bogor Agricultural University are eager to undertake the
  research (broadly outlined in this Concept Note ), and serve as the
  host institution to foreign faculty researchers and graduate students.
  We anticipate mobilizing corporate CSR funds to build and equip the
  center, and have commenced preliminary discussions with several likely
  candidates. But as an indication of global interest in this
    landscape ecology approach, and as a stimulus to create government
    and corporate support, we are crowd-funding the very first step : architectural drawings for the center, and an engineering
    feasibility study. The concept we have for the building is bold. To be located on a
  previously burned, now grassy area across a small peatwater stream
  from the forest, the center will be both state-of-the-art and
  off-grid. It will be constructed in part from fallen logs that are in
  the peatwater stream, which because of the tannins are now rock-hard
  and insect-resistant. It will be circular in shape, with a donut hole
  in its center to act as a heat convector to draw in cooling breezes
  from around its periphery. It is to be roofed with solar cells. And
  among the research activities will be an investigation into local
  non-oil-palm options for biofuel to run the shuttle boats' outboard
  motors, so that we can be wholly carbon-neutral. There is an innovative, highly creative architectural firm in Vietnam
  with stellar and award-winning ""green"" concepts that has
  agreed to draw up the design. Have a look at their projects - I particularly like their 'Farming Kindergarten'! The output will include: - 3D images - 3 exteriors (main view x 2, 1 night view), 2 interior
  (1 hall and a room) - Single line facility basic plans -
  scale:1/300, 4 stories - 1 Section - reasonable scale - 1
  Section Diagram to show the sustainable idea of the building -
  Architectural English description - A powerpoint presentation
  data for architectural concept Help us get started! We will respond to all donors who wish
  to be kept informed not only with our thanks, but with progress
  updates. And maybe one day you can come to visit the center, for a
  section of it will be used for ecotourism – a model for how forest
  communities can directly benefit from biodiversity.",https://fundrazr.com/d12o10

505,Please Help Launch Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered,Business,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,,,12,"Hi, My name is Akosua Albritton, a resident of Brooklyn, and I'm on a
  mission to move Brooklyn from an ""outer borough"" to Brooklyn
  front and center. I'm growing a tour guide business called Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered that offers a nature
  walk, neighborhood walks,  presentations, a tour of churches, and
  visits to places of interests. New itineraries pop out of my head. Before starting Brooklyn Treasures Uncovered , I
  taught a Summer Intensive that was called History of Blacks in
  Brooklyn for 11 years at a local college. My adult learners
  brought their families and friends along to enjoy the places we
  visited and listen to my talks. It was a fun way to learn. When a
  friend heard my description of my class, she said, "" You
    should turn it into a business--just don't give them tests ."" It took me a few years to act on my friend's suggestion. Then, I
  approached a public high school (Erasmus Hall High) to promote it as
  an afterschool program. While the school considered it, I began taking
  members of senior centers out to places and did presentations at a
  community room, a church, and under the Sailors and Soldiers Monument
  at Grand Army Plaza. So my business needs fuel to grow and thrive. It needs
    $11,000 for essential business set up , sales &
  marketing, and product development. Will you please chip in
    $35, $50, $100 or more to get this business on firm
  ground?  I have great thank you gifts for your support.  The details
  are in another section. Last thing, Brooklyn waft it's magic on me years ago when I
    took the A train the wrong direction. Instead of heading
  to lower Manhattan, the train went deeper into Brooklyn. I got off at
  the Nostrand Avenue stop.  I walked up the stairs to the surface to
  find religious groups promoting themselves--one on each of the four
  corners. One corner had Shango Baptists dressed in red and white,
  another had Hebrew Israelites who I intially thought were pirates, the
  other had clean cut Nation of Islam reps, and the fourth had a nearby
  Christian church member reading from the Bible. I had never seen such
  a spectacle. Four years later, I moved to Brooklyn five blocks away

155,A potentially highly efficacious drug for stroke,Business,Pound Sterling,,of £500k goal,,,7,"What is carnosine? Carnosine is a small molecule that is found naturally in different
  parts of the body including the various cells of the brain. There is
  substantial published scientific literature that supports the view
  that Carnosine has many beneficial effects on the body and may even
  slow down ageing. Carnosine is a versatile molecule in that it protects the brain from
  immediate and long-term stresses and dangers. It has been shown that
  Carnosine is a powerful antioxidant and a feel radical scavenger but
  its benefits go well beyond this property. For example, Carnosine has
  been shown to inhibit excitotoxicity. (Excitoxicity is the excessive
  and toxic release of a neurotransmitter called glutamate from damaged
  brain cells during stroke). Excitotoxicity damages surrounding
  uninjured cells which may have survived the initial injury caused by
  stroke. It also buffers the acidic environment in the brain that is
  created by the stroke which is injurious to brain cells.
  Significantly, it inhibits enzymes called matrix-metalloproteinases
  that are released from damaged brain tissue. These enzymes break down
  the architecture of surrounding normal cells and increase brain damage
  and reduce the chances of recovery. When was it first discovered and what does the research show? Carnosine was first discovered over 100 years ago but its potential
  medicinal benefits have only recently been unravelling. There is
  considerable interest in Carnosine as an anti-ageing molecule and many
  people around the world are taking Carnosine purchased from health
  food stores to slow down ageing and prevent dementia because some
  studies show that it can enhance cognition in humans. Carnosine may help to protect the brain from stroke Scientists also believe that Carnosine may protect the brain from
  stroke if it is given to patients soon after their stroke symptoms
  start. A neurologist and neuroscientist, Professor Arshad Majid at the
      University of Sheffield in England did a series of experiments
    in cellular and animal models of stroke and has shown that Carnosine
    can protect the brain against experimental stroke. This is
  a considerable discovery because no protective drugs currently exist
  which protect the brain when stroke occurs. Although clot-busting
  medications are occasionally used for patients suffering from stroke,
  side-effects and other timing factors mean that only a small fraction
  of patients suffering from stroke will receive these medicines. However, Carnosine with its multiple beneficial effects highlighted
  above may protect the brain from stroke in humans if it is given in
  the vein. Professor Majid said that further testing is needed before
  this medication can be tested in human trials. However, this testing cannot be carried out because there is no
      patent being held by anyone. This means that large
  pharmaceutical companies will not be able to make a profit on this
  medication even if it is successfully developed for human use.
  Consequently, a potentially valuable and efficacious drug cannot be
  developed any further due to lack of commercial interest. Professor
  Majid wants to develop this exciting molecule if funding was available
  to complete the extra experiments that are needed before clinical
  testing in humans can begin.

  Relations college major. I live in Jamaica, and I'm a huge makeup
  enthusiast who wants to pursue freelance makeup artistry because I'd
  like to be able to support myself through college, but most
  importantly, makeup makes me happy. It makes me happy knowing I can
  make someone else happy by making them feel beautiful. I do makeup to
  inspire and to uplift. There are so many BEAUTIFUL women and girls out
  there who don't feel beautiful, and even though you don't need makeup
  to be beautiful, it's nice to make them feel beautiful even for just a
  few hours. I need your help to make my vision a reality. In Jamaica, tools
  are expensive and good quality is scarce. That's why I'd love for you
  to help in any way you can by donating and then sharing my campaign so
  that I can purchase my tools and products, cover importation costs and
  also begin to advertising my services. It's important that I have
  quality products because I will be a professional after all, and
    who will trust a makeup artist with inferior products, right? I've already taken all the steps to ensure that I will
  become the best of the best. I've never been more passionate about

164,Please donate towards Addisyn's Medical costs READ,Healt,Australian Dollar,,of $5k goal,,,2,"Addisyn Rose Simpson This is a long story, but please take the time to read all of
    it. Thank you! My tiny little princess Addi was born on the 08.12.2017 weighing 4
  pound 5 ounces, absolutely tiny for a full term baby but my little
  Addi unfortunately had other issues. Addisyn was my fourth child, I have Kade - 6 , Kobi - 3 & Ivy -
  15 months! After having 3 perfectly healthy beautiful babies prior I
  didn't expect to be told at my 20 week scan that I would have to go
  back for a specialist scan because they had found abnormalities in my
  daughters heart. Unfortunately worst then first thought Addisyn would be born to
  suffer from the worst congenital heart defect -Tetralogy of Fallot
  (TOF). Having TOF means that instead of one CHD Addisyn suffers from
  3+. Addi has 2 VSD's (holes in her heart) one being quite large that
  requires surgery before she is 6 months old, her outflow tract that
  connects her heart to her lungs is far too narrow, she has a thickened
  right ventricle & one of her main arteries is in the wrong
  position so it is not pumping blood the right way. The worst part
  about it all is the chd's she has all affects blood flow to her lungs,
  Addisyn is on a heart monitor consantly, she struggles with breathing
  quite often, she gets tired very quickly, her weight is stunted (she
  is nearly 2 months old and the same size as a normal newborn baby) ,
  she sometimes turns blue from lack of oxygen & even if she gets
  too wound up or loses her breath when she cries she will turn blue
  & start having seizures! TOF is fatal if left untreated, 50% of
  TOF sufferers who don't seek treatment die before the age of six!!
  That is why it is super important we get Addi all the help we can get
  for her! Unfortunately no one in Tasmania specialises in TOF so we have to
  travel to Melbourne to be seen for all of her appointments regarding
  her heart and even more unfortunately there is no funding allocated to
  help us with these travelling cost. Addi's first specialist
  appointment is booked for next month and we have had to pay $200 in
  flights return, $170 on a hotel in Melbourne CBD and we have had to
  put $200 aside for anything else I may have to pay for (taxi's, food
  etc) That is $570 just for one appointment and these are appointments
  Addi has to attend monthly until surgery. Addisyn has to have at least 3 open heart surgeries to correct her
  TOF. That makes for at least 3 times we have to fly to Melbourne and
  pay for accommodation for 3 weeks over there while she recovers! The
  Hospital will pay for Addisyn and myself's flights and subsided
  accommodation but if we want my husband & our 3 other children to
  be able to come and support there sister / daughter we will have to
  fund there flights and accommodation! I have spent no more then a full
  48 hours without seeing my children, if we are unable to afford to
  have them come to Melbourne with us I would be absolutely devastated
  and so distraught and with them only being 6, 3 & 14 months old
  they are far too young to be without there mother for 3 week periods!
  So PLEASE dig deep & if you are able to please donate to us to
  help fund Addisyn's Medical & travelling expenses we would be
  forever grateful!! We would love to be all kept together as a family!

      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this

"2,530",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Healt,Canadian Dollar,"Jul 6, 2018",of $40k goal,,,22,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor

"462,014",British Gut,Healt,,,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"10,295",Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,Healt,U.S. Dollar,,of $125k goal,,,63,"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED:  MEDICAL AND BASIC LIVING EXPENSES Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special needs are met. I give him the peace of mind that I will
    never leave his side and the assurance he will always be safe.  With
    neither one of us working, continuing to pay for Jack’s medical
    expenses and our living expenses is an impossibility without the
    help of others. Not having medical insurance, we have received some
    financial help from the hospital’s social welfare department.
    However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will continue. We
    have monthly expenses in the USA that also add to our financial
    burden.  Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. BREAKDOWN OF MONTHLY EXPENSES I NEED HELP WITH WHILE JACK IS HOSPITLALIZED Monthly Medical at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital: average of
      $7205.50 USD $8,451.00 USD (Sept) $5,960.00 USD (Oct) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses (rent, utilities,
    internet/phones, transportation, food) :  $1,065.00 USD Monthly Upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
    loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses when Living at Home (rent, utilities, internet/phones, transportation,
    food): $1,215.00 USD Monthly upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
  loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) Radiation:  $2,000 USD (one time charge) When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will allow me to pay for our apartment
    rent, utilities, food and transportation expenses.  I can also pay
    my USA debts directly from USA checking account. The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen",https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack

    Campbell, is a single working mother of two who was preparing
  to list the house for a quick sale when this occurred. Miraculously, there was no injury or loss of life, but the house and everything in it was a total loss. The house and its contents were her only assets. Mortgage
    payments continue to be due each month as well as other household
    expenses, which apparently can’t be stopped even after your house
    burns down (i.e., property taxes. HOA fees and sewer bills).   If
    she doesn't continue paying the mortgage, insurance will not give
    her anything on the claim and the house will go into foreclosure. If
    she doesn't pay the other house bills, liens will be put on the
    property, jeopardizing her ownership of the land.  Anne does not
    have the financial wherewithal to continue paying the house bills
    while the insurance process drags along.  Nor will insurance fully
    cover the losses.  She currently cannot sell the property as planned. If you are able, please consider contributing to help Anne recover from her losses. Any amount would be

  the mixing of my private life and business life, and help as much as I
  can. The best way I can help is to raise money to send directly to my

  who need it. People whose homes have been destroyed, people living in
  tents, people who are suffering. Any money raised will be sent quickly
  to meet the most immediate needs; food, water, shelter. I will be
  sending money directly to my colleagues who are experienced and
  reliable community leaders. I trust them 100% and they are kind,

"3,191",Ty's Horse Accident Fundraiser,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,,,39,"On 8/27/16 our daughter, Ty, had a bad accident at one of her horse
  shows. She has suffered a severe concussion, it has caused her severe
  stuttering, tremors, and an inability to walk on her own. Between the
  medical bills from the hospital, doctors, speech and physical therapy,
  any financial assistance is greatly appreciated. Details of what happened: Fiona refused a jump. Ty's bad hip popped, she had no strength
    in it after that to hold, Fiona went down on her knees (Horse is ok)
    and Ty went Head Over Heels over Fiona's neck and head. Severe
    concussion causing severe stutter, shaking, and inability to walk on
    her own. For those who are not ""horsie"" and familiar with our
    terms. Refusing a jump means the horse suddenly stops right before
    they are to jump over their obstacle. That might be at a trot or
    canter (canter being faster than trot, trot is faster than walk).
    When a horse (Fiona is an OTTB, Off The Track Thoroughbred, and
    weighs approximately 1200-1300 lbs) does that, it is sudden and
    jolts you. When that happened Tyras hip gave way and she couldn't
    hold herself in place well enough to stay balanced in the saddle.
    Tyra injured her right hip 1 1/2 years ago during school track and
    we've been working with it since and she started riding again this
    year with the Orthopedic Specialists ok. When Ty lost that balance
    then that through her weight onto Fionas front-end too much, causing
    Fiona to go to her knees. When Fiona fell to her knees that then
    caused Tyra to fly out of the saddle over Fionas head. She landed
    flat on her back and hit the back of her head on the ground (with
    helmet on). This was nobodies fault, not Tyras, not Fionas, not
    Tyras trainer (who is a very good friend of ours and an excellent
    rider and trainer). This was just one of those days that sometimes
    happen. You do what you can to make sure you're child is safe, to
    make sure they know what they are doing, to make sure they have the
    proper safety gear, etc... so they can do what they love. Sometimes
    things just happens that you can't always control, this is one of
    those times. Horses are not for the faint of heart. ;) Fiona is ok
    and Tyra will be ok. She's a tough girl and a stubborn one at that.
    ;) And I know she herself, God, and all of us will get her through this. As most know we have done horse rescue for 13+ years and fund the
  majority of it ourselves. If you'd like to help with that please

"2,225",The Old Man and the Schooner,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,,,33,"The Old man And The Schooner... Captain Ron Strathman and his 1977 wooden schooner have been cruising
  the Sea of Cortez for over 6 years together.  Their journeys became
  one over 10 years ago, each of them living many different lives
  before.  The man built a successful safety company in San Diego at an
  age when most of us would have long since retired.  Working long hours
  to geneate the funds necesary to restore a 30 year old neglected
  wooden boat with cracked frames, rotten masts, and varnish that had
  gone black for want of a loving hand; he arrived home late at night
  day after day, week after week, and year after year, often to be found
  sanding in the dark. When you rerstore an old wooden boat with your own bare hands, there
  is a magic created that none will know if they have not completed this
  arduous balancing act of love and hate.  If one is strong enough, as
  Ron was for all those years, finally the day comes that they will
  stand back at days end and look, not mesmerized by a glowing coat of
  varnish on the cap rail, not transfixed by a single run in an
  otherwise flawless coat of paint, but in sheer awe of the vessel that
  floats before them, ready to put to sea once more. Ron gave life to this vessel.  What's more, is that she gave new life
  to him; each one offering the other, another chance at freedom.  It
  has been said that ships are the closest things to dreams ever made by
  human hand.  This dream is in grave danger of becoming a nightmare. Hurricane Odile Ravaged the coast of baja in September of 2014.  The
  Gold Eagle lay well prepared in Marina Santa Rosalia.  When the winds
  maxed out over 100kts, the marina came apart, it's and other debris
  slowly piling up alongside the Gold Eagle.  Eventually for all her
  well placed lines and tackle, she was overwhelmed by the weight and
  with a splintering of the pilings around her, fell into the marina
  ramp destroying it completely. While most other vessels in the Baja region where floated in the days
  following the disaster, Gold Eagle has not been so fortunate.  Demands
  where filed against the vessel on the grounds that she had destroyed
  marina property and that she must pay repair costs.  Ron was in fear
  of imprisonment on the same grounds.  All his attempts to float the
  vessel including the help of a 100 ton crane where denied by the local
  authorities.  The vessel had been seized. After breif re-grouping in San Diego in order to seek legal advice,
  replace his documents (all where awash on board the schooner and never
  found after the hurricane), and some clothes (also awash),  Ron is on
  his way back to Santa Rosalia, armed with an attorney who has resolved
  the seizure, and all necessary facilities needed to float the vessel. While this is a great victory for them, the process of rebuilding a
  life destroyed is all but hopeless.  For this reason, we ask for your
  generous contribution to this cause.  If ever you had a dream to do
  something small or great, wether you suceeded or not, we hope you will
  see it in your heart to help the Old Man and the Schooner, to sail again.",https://fundrazr.com/5ssRf

  to place a plate and screws into her leg. On July 1st a severe bone
  infection was discovered and treatment with IV antibiotics began. Kris
  was then transported from a hospital in Pagosa Springs, CO to San Juan
  Regional Medical Center in Farmington, NM. Since her initial operation
  on May 15th, she has had 4 operations. The first was to clean the wound. The second was a follow-up surgery
  to ensure maximum cleanliness. After a couple of days, the doctor
  noticed a blister that forming on her wound so he preformed another
  operation. This time, to remove the plate and 8 screws that had gotten
  infected. The doctors later found that her bone had started getting
  infected where the hardware was initially placed so they performed
  another surgery to put an antibiotic rod in her bone meant to treat
  her inner bone infection. The last 25 days have been some of the most physically painful days
  she has ever had to face to date and she will most likely need a
  surgery just to get a skin graph in the future. This would've been her 7th year as a wildland firefighter,  which is

  unemployed until her recovery is complete and is en route to an
  extended stay care facility called AMG Albuquerque ( http://amgalbuquerque.com/ ). She has already been in the hospital for almost a month and will

"99,544",Baby Luca's will to live,Accidents,Canadian Dollar,,of $100k goal,,,1186,"It was a beautiful Monday afternoon, long weekend, the sun was out,
  kids were playing having a wonderful time. On May 19th 2014 our lives
  were shattered when our loving, charasmatic, beautiful 21 month old
  baby boy suffered a near drowning. Found and pulled out of the water
  within minutes was given CPR but had no vital signs. Rushed to the
  local hospital where a team of doctors and nurses worked on his
  lifeless body and revived Luca after 27 mintues. We prayed so hard
  that Jesus would give us our baby back and by the Grace of God our
  baby came back. We knew at this point that Luca wanted to be here and
  was not ready to go to be with Jesus and this is how our fight began................... His weak and sick little body was transported to Sick Kids by the
  orange team, sitting in that seat watching my baby fighting for his
  life the nurse turns to me and says "" you have a very sick little
  boy that may or may not make it no matter what happens please keep
  your seatbelt on and keep calm."" I was praying the whole ride to
  Sick Kids begging Jesus to please let me see my baby smile again. We
  got to Sick Kids where we were asked to sit in a room where the doctor
  would come talk to us. We were greeted by a doctor who came in and
  could'nt even look at us in the face and said what was our worst
  nightmare "" Things are not looking good in there, your baby is
  having a very hard time breathing, I've seen this type of injury
  before and the child has serious neurological problems or they usually
  pass away."" Devastated, shocked, confused walked out of that room
  shared this news with a quiet waiting room full of friends and family
  that shortly became complete chaos. The time came where we could see our baby, shaking and scared we came
  face to face with our baby that was fighting for his life, a machine
  breathing for him, a blanket regulating his temperature, iv's all over
  his body, medication to regulate his blood pressure, antibiotic for
  infection, a neckbrace to keep his head alligned and the list goes on. Days and nights passed, medications were coming off one by one. MRI
  was scheduled. Luca was showing very little signs of life, but for us
  a little bit of life was enough for us to fight for our baby Luca. Post one week MRI showed severe brain damage, we were devastated.
  Doctors then discussed taking out his his breathing tube to see if he
  could breath on his own. Knowing that this machine was keeping our
  baby alive we wanted to make sure that he was strong enough. The day came post 2 weeks accident everyone was ready, they took out
  this tube that was keeping my baby alive, he was doing amazing
  breathing on his own for an hour when things took a turn for the worse
  they needed to put the tube back, he couldn't breathe on his own. We
  were broken. We had a meeting with the doctors who said that things were not
  looking good, Luca did not have a cough, gag, or swallow and was told
  he was never going to get them back. Devastated and confused I just
  could not imagine my life without this amazing little boy I knew that
  Jesus had a plan for him. More tests were scheduled a hearing test that showed he was deaf and
  an eye test that showed inconclusive but most likely blind. We knew in
  our hearts that this could not be it. He came back to life after 27
  minutes he has plans to stay. Doctors planned to take Luca's breathing tube out again and asked us
  to sign papers if we wanted to put it back if it failed , we signed
  the papers we couldn't give up yet. The extabation (taking the
  breathing tube out) was going to happen on Tuesday 10th
  well................ that Saturday Luca had a gag it was barely even
  there but it was there, Monday of that week Luca had a cough it was
  faint but it was a cough. We felt so ready for the extabation that was
  going to happen on that Tuesday. Extabation day........ scariest day of our lives. Everyone was there
  ready as can be i asked if i could hold Luca when they took it out.
  Holding him close to my chest singing "" You are my Sunshine""
  they slowly took it out. I continued to sing to him he was doing so
  well for an hour and a half that's when our little Luca started
  struggling to breathe. We did sign papers to put the tube back but i
  knew in my heart that i could not put my baby through this again, we
  decided right there not to put it back. We called his older loving
  sisters and our family so we could be there with him as he took his
  last breath. A miracle happened right there and then Luca continued to breathe on
  his own one hr went by, then three hrs and seven hours, a day. It was
  amazing to see this little baby and his will to survive. Bad news again......... he would not be able to control his
  secretions because his gag was so weak and his cough was barely even
  there he would die in a couple of days. I knew in my heart that my
  baby was going to prove everyone wrong..... even the doctors. We decided that we wanted to be transferred to a centre that was for
  children that were at the end of their life. If my baby was going to
  die in a couple of days i wanted his last days to be spent outside
  blowing bubbles, watching his sisters do cartwheels and breathing
  fresh air. A special place called Emily's house would be our next stop. What an amazing place......... we spent every minute with Luca and
  his big sisters trying to make every moment a memorable one. Luca was
  definitely not at the end of his life more like the beginning of his
  life. Luca started to move, tracking, smiling, crying it was amazing
  to see him slowly improve. This is when we started alternative
  therapy. Hyperbaric chamber was first and boy did Luca really wake up
  there. Thanks to a very special person for guiding me in the right
  direction and your generous donation. We love you. We stayed at
  Emily's House for 2 months learning about Luca's care. Everyone there
  was AMAZING. They taught us everything we needed to know to go home,
  from giving medications to suctioning and everything in between. On
  August 24th we were disharged and ready to go home. It was bittersweet
  we felt so blessed to have our baby Luca home but missed everything
  that we had before the accident. We are now seeking extensive therapies to get the most out of his
  recovery that are unfortunately not covered by insurance. We are
  asking for prayers and donations any amount contributed to Luca's
  recovery is truly appreciated",https://fundrazr.com/aro49

"3,318",Support Black Panther Robert Seth Hayes!,Health,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,,,77,"Robert Seth Hayes is one of the longest held political prisoners in
  the US. After returning from the Vietnam War, Seth joined the Black
  Panther Party and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the
  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after
  serving 25 years he is eligible for parole. Seth has now been locked
  in prison for 42 years and unjustly denied parole on 10 occasions.
  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn
  for his release. Seth turns 67 this year and suffers from multiple
  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life
  in prison without the possibility parole. Seth is challenging this
  violation of his constitutional rights with a Habeas petition. Seth needs our support. Please make a contribution to this

  and have luckly had the support from friends and family.. Unfortunately I was not so lucky concerning my employment... I was
  'let go'from my position (unofficially for being transgender) and have
  since been unable to find employment ANYWHERE ... I worked in the

  fact that I am openly transgender I am in a situation where I Have
  become unemployable! This loss of financial security and stoppage placed upon my
  transition has caused me to fall into a  state of anxiety and

"2,955",Help for Howard,Health,U.S. Dollar,,of $11.3k goal,,,25,"Written diligently on my phone over many hours as we are presently
  without a working computer in our home... Hey All- While it seemed that nothing but fake news was all that one could
  find wherever one looked, my world just got very real with some
  information regarding my health. Briefly, here is the gist of it all... Recently I've been struggling with issues of balance and hearing and
  was referred to a neurologist and subsequently to have an MRI of my head. These scans revealed a growth on my right side, and I was diagnosed
  with a vestibular schwannoma. So, what is that anyway? I know, it sounds like a sandwich, but in fact is a slow growing
  tumor originating off of my auditory nerve. Sometimes called an auditory neuroma, these growths are considered
  pretty rare overall. The good news is that it is self-contained and benign. The growth is not actually in my brain, but rather beginning to press
  on various nerves which are associated with my ability to walk,
  balance and function particularly affecting my right side. Apparently this thing has been growing for  20-30 years and first
  began to reach a size to where its presence affected the
  aforementioned nerves a few short months ago and has me to the point
  of my  not getting around that well. Given the size of the tumor and the ways it is impacting my life, the
  best option is a surgery to remove the growth. Eventually, if not removed or somehow reduced in size, the tumor will
  continue its slow but steady growth and my functionality will decrease
  and at some point my brain will run out of room to accommodate this
  impeding guest. This could be another 20-30 years but I am already experiencing
  significant loss of my abilities and quality of life. I am a total proponent of our own innate abilities to reduce and/or
  reverse growths and such in our bodies and surgery has been something
  that I've shied away from even until recently. Hell, I've spent most of the last 20+ years working tirelessly to
  hold this perspective for clients who have lost sight of these very truths. That said, I still come from the same place but am humbly, after much
  inner dialogue, choosing to go ahead with the surgery. Honestly I reached this decision after realizing that I lacked a
  certain strength and really needed help. The surgery is scheduled for the morning of the 12th and will take
  about 5 hours. This is unfamiliar ground for me, as it surely is for most. I am pretty scared and well out of my comfort zone! Following the surgery, my stay in the hospital should only be 3-5
  days with a possible indeterminate time at an in-patient rehab
  facility thereafter. The length of time at the rehab will depend on how well and quickly I
  can recalibrate and recover my abilities to balance and walk, etc... As far as recovery and returning to work, I'm being told a month
  depending on how I respond. The other day I had the occasion to speak with a local woman who
  underwent basically the same procedure a few years ago and she related
  it taking almost 3 months before she was feeling ready to get back to
  her job. Everyone is different and each case unique, I get that.  What I mean
  to say is that there are many unknowns... Hence my creating this campaign to ask for your financial assistance. I have not worked in at least a month, and it's been 2 or more since
  I've done anything full time. Fortunately I do have insurance, albeit limited coverage, through my
  wife's employer, but the bills are already beginning to wrack up. With doctor visits, running here and there, plus 2 MRIs the costs are
  already well beyond our means with the surgery, hospital stay and
  potential rehab yet to come. I'm not going to endlessly post asking for your assistance. If you can or want to donate towards this, cool. And if you can't or don't want to, also cool. Share or don't share as you see fit, both are good. I'm not going to make any promises here  that could come around to
  weigh upon me should I be unable to fulfill them. Please don't be put off by the goal, as this  amount was only set to
  not limit our cause here. Of course anything offered is a great gesture of kindness and totally appreciated! Lastly, I really hope to impart that what is most relevant and
  welcomed is your words and love during this time. Yes the money piece is important, and something that really takes a
  lot of my energy as I worry about that side of things  but what I
  truly seek right now is connection with those I love. If you are reading this then in some way you fall into that category. I'm not very communicative especially on social media, and definitely
  even less so as of late. I wasn't in the right awareness until now to fully disclose all that
  I've been dealing with. Part of my way of addressing things is to reach further into my own
  depths for understanding. Sometimes this can be interpreted as polarizing or dismissive but I
  assure you this has not been my intention. I'm simply trying to be okay, like we all are. I guess I'm a stoically private guy when it comes to my personal
  life, but for those who do have interest I wanted to share some of
  what's been going down with me. Peace and Thank You, Howard",https://fundrazr.com/01EjG6

  what he was told by a walk-in clinic doctor, was nothing more than a flu. For 15 days, Paul was in a medically induced coma and on life support
  while doctors were frantically fighting to save his life!! Paul was infected by a bacteria called ""Invasive Group A

"4,015",Let's get Linda back on her feet!,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,,,41,"On June 4, 2016, Linda Wendt sustained a catastrophic brain
  injury after falling while she was out on a family walk in Kingston.
  We were told she might not survive, but she managed to pull through.
  After nearly three months in the hospital, Linda was discharged back
  home to continue her rehabilitation as an outpatient. We quickly
  learned that her recovery was just beginning. At 64 years young, Linda was known for her generosity, her
  stamina, and her sense of humor. She was also a talented folk musician
  who loved physical activity. David was just about to retire when the
  accident occurred. Their plan was to move to Kingston to be closer to
  their son and daughter-in-law (Phillip and Katherine) and, more
  importantly, their grandchildren (Holly and Collin). Linda was an
  incredibly engaged and dedicated grandmother, with boundless energy
  for getting down on the floor and playing with the kids. Everyone
  remarked how much she ""lit up"" when she was around them. Since Linda's injury, she has been severely limited by various
  physical complications of the brain injury. The most significant of
  these are crushing fatigue, dizziness/fainting owing to sudden drops
  in blood pressure, and nearly complete vision loss. Luckily, Linda has
  retained her core personality and cognitive abilities, and she is
  approaching her limitations with a sense of practical optimism.
  Unfortunately, she is not able to do most of the things she used to
  enjoy (reading, gardening, going for long walks, running around with
  the grandkids, etc.). Even playing music will be a big challenge, as
  she will not be able to follow regular music scores. This is why we have started this campaign: To raise funds to
  help get Linda back on her feet when she returns to Kingston for good
  in November. Although the vision loss is permanent, the other problems
  have the potential to improve through hard work and regular outpatient
  rehabilitation in the home. There are also many assistive devices that
  could help Linda to compensate for the disabilities (for example,
  mobility aids, safety equipment, and electronic devices). These things
  cost money, and lots of it! For example, a low vision music reader can
  cost $3,000 ( http://www.dancingdots.com/main/index.htm ) and
  Phillip estimates that a year of twice weekly private rehabilitation
  would cost around $9,600 Cdn. Although we are lucky to live in a
  country where core health services are publicly subsidized, these
  particular services and items are not. We believe that having access
  to them could make the difference between thriving and surviving. You
  can check out various innovative products available to people with low
  vision at this link: http://shop.cnib.ca/ . Linda has done so much for so many over the years and now we
  have an opportunity to return the favour, in whatever small way we
  can. $5, $10, or whatever you can manage would make a difference. For
  those of you from the United States, your donations would reap the
  benefit of the current exchange rate, which would increase the value
  of each US dollar by 25% when converted to Canadian funds!
  Contributions will be automatically deposited in a PayPal account
  under David's name, to be used at Linda and David's discretion. We
  will provide regular updates on Linda's progress and keep you in the
  loop about significant purchases and services that have been arranged. **If you are donating from Canada, please note that your
  donation will be processed in U.S. currency.**",https://fundrazr.com/71AiF8

100,A Christmas for Mary,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,,,1,"Hi there! For those of you who do not know me, my name is Amand Byrd.
  My daughter Mary-Adalynn and I are currently suffering in more ways
  than one. Due to a horrific and unfortunate event that recently took
  place with my husband, Mary's father and my mother in law, Mary's
  grandmother, our entire world has been flipped upside down practically
  over night. We are soon to be without a home on top of everything
  else. It's going to take some time for me to pull things together and
  figure out just where to go from here. I am currently doing all that I
  physically can as far as finding and applying for the resources needed
  in order to find childcare for Mary so that I can begin working full
  time. But as of right now, we're in trouble... I can't even afford the
  remainder of this months bills, let alone the gifts from Santa that
  Mary is counting down the days and looking very forward to. I keep
  telling myself that if we can just somehow make it through Christmas... Every penny counts right now. But I also realize that this is often a
  difficult time of year for Many. So, if you are in a position to help
  and feel lead to do so, then by all means... BUT I would NEVER expect
  another less fortunte family or individual to even think twice about
  this request.",https://fundrazr.com/Maryadalynn
725,Please help Onthebackfoot get back on the road,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $5.5k goal,,,21,"I'm Jan an Instagram friend of Onthebackfoot. On December 13th Onthebackfoot's Ridley Excalibur was stolen in
  Austin Texas - his only bike. Onthebackfoot is passionate about sharing his love of cycling by
  posting photo's on Instagram from the 70's, 80's and 90's and writing
  a few poetic descriptions along the way.  He preserves memories of the
  heroic efforts from times long gone that brings joy to many. I share
  his passion of cycling and the times when we were young and romantic. As a fellow cyclist from the vintage era I would like to help
  Onthebackfoot get back on the road by raising funds to replace his
  stolen bike. In the ""old"" days, when cycling was the passionate domain
  of a few diehards we never thought twice about stopping when you saw a
  fellow cyclist on the side of the road struggling with a sewup or
  spontaneously ride together even if you never met the person. We knew
  that we had something in common, a bond, a shared passion that was
  cycling.  We'd chat about each other's bikes and components - and yes
  we'd snicker about Shimano index shifting. We'd talk about the latest
  issue of Mirroire de Cyclisme or Velonews, the coolest bikes shops
  selling Italian frames or the latest exploits of 7-Eleven, Greg
  Lemond, Hampsten, Longo or Nelson Vails. More often than not it lead
  to good friendships and joyous moments. It is Onthebackfoot who
  elicits some the memories that time has passed us by.  Cycling is not
  all about numbers, or power rather, cycling is about passion,
  socializing, sharing and pushing one's own limits while dreaming of
  racing with Eddy Merckx, Gimondi, and Meartens on the cols and
  cobbles. So when a fellow cyclist suffers a misfortune - we as
  comrades always step up and figuratively give them a push up the hill.
  It is what cyclists do. In that spirit we should help Onthebackfoot, a fellow cyclist whom I
  never met but admire from afar to get back on the road because it is
  what we used to do. If you can contribute to the cause it will bring
  joy to someone who brings a smile to everyone.",https://fundrazr.com/71Bv92
"3,090",Please Help Me Help an Injured Dog,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,,,85,"Hi. My name is Joey Lott. Chances are, if you are reading this, you already know me or are
  familiar with me and what I do. But in the off chance that you have found this because somebody
  shared it with you, let me briefly tell you that should you wish to
  know something more about me, you can see my personal site at
  joeylott.com or Google my name and find information about me pretty easily. This fundraiser is intended to raise funds to help cpver the medical
  bills for a dog I found today. He is a large, neutered male dog with long, thick white hair and blue
  eyes. I am not good at recognizing most dog breeds, but my best guess
  is he is at least part husky. I came upon the dog as I was driving north on I-25 near the Bernal,
  New Mexico exit. I saw him lying in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes. He was lying upright, which was surreal because I do not generally
  expect to see a large dog lying apparently calmly in the median of the
  interstate highway. I pulled over and crossed into the median. As I approached he
  remained calm and just looked at me with his blue eyes. I reached down and touched him. He did not startle or seem adverse to
  me touching him. I inspected him, and I found a small amount of blood on his rear leg,
  but I did not see any obvious or serious injuries. On further inspection, it seemed fairly obvious that one of his read
  legs had been snapped. It was complletely limp. I attempted to pick him up, but he yelped in pain. Plus, he is quite
  heavy, and I was concerned about being able to make it across the lane
  carrying him by myself as cars whizzed by at 80 mph. So I waved down a car. A man helped me to carry the dog to my car and
  lay him in back. I drove on to Las Vegas, New Mexico where I called information to
  find a vet or animal care center in the area. I found one animal hospital with emergency care. I called the
  emergency number,and the vet agreed to meet me at the hospital. He said that he would not charge me to euthanize the dog. But it
  seemed to me that the dog was still quite strong. Other than his
  broken leg, I believed he was otherwise physically okay. So for $215 the vet agreed to look at the dog and determine if he was
  likely to recover and the extent of the injuries. I continued on my errand. An hour later, the vet called me and told
  me that he had examined the dog and performed some x-rays, and he said
  that the dog appeared to be in good shape with no other injuries
  except a complete break of his rear, right leg. The cost to perform the surgery to place a pin in the dog's leg and
  allow him to heal and recover is $2000. My family does not currently have $2000 to spare. So I am hoping to
  raise the funds. I am asking for $2500, which will cover the initial $215 cost plus
  the $2000 cost for the surgery and aftercare as well as the
  fundraising fees (5%). I am sorry that I do not have any photos of the dog. I have an old
  filp-phone without a camera and I do not carry a camera on me. So I
  was not able to get photos of the dog. But if you saw him, your heart would melt. Please help with anything you can give. Every dollar helps. And although the likelihood of people who don't know me contributing
  is low, if you know of people who might want to contribute, please so
  share this and vouch for my integrity if you feel moved to do so. Unfortunately, I don't know what the next step is once the dog
  recovers (assuming he does). I don't think my family can take another
  dog in right now. And New Mexico has a major problem with unwanted
  dogs, so it's complicated. But I will cross that bridge when I get to it. I intend to try to get
  the word out in case he is wanted and simply went missing. That is a
  possibility since he is neutered, healthy, and wearing a collar
  (though no tags). I'm not getting my hopes up for that. But it is a possibility. And if
  that doesn't work out, I will do my best to figure out the next steps
  to find him a new home. If you or somebody you know lives near the Bernal exit on I-25 in New
  Mexico, please help get the word out. And contact me at joeylott@gmail.com . Thank you for your help.",https://fundrazr.com/dog-surgery
"16,709",Help Find Jerry!,Accidents,,,,,,,"Jerry Krause, an American pilot and Mission Aviation Fellowship alum, went missing on Sunday, April 7th on a ferry flight from South Africa to Mali.  It is unknown as to whether or not his plane was hijacked or if he crashed.  No concrete evidence has been found for either scenario.  The government's involvement has been minimal, forcing the Krause family and SAS (Sahel Aviation Service, Jerry's employer) to pay for an investigation out of pocket.  Please know that there is no obligation, but many have asked how they can contribute monetarily on top of their daily prayers.  If you feel led to bless the family, we genuinely appreciate it as equipment, flights, and those contributing to the search have started to cost more than anticipated.

"30,880",Help us to rebuild ancient villages from ashes,Accidents,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,,,29,"SUMBA ISLAND Sumba is one of the few islands in Indonesia where a
      majority of the population still follow the ways of their
      ancestors. The social structure of Sumba is organized around the
      traditional ancestral house and the patrilineal group that claims
      decent from it. Ancestral houses are the bridge between the visible and
    invisible worlds and must be perpetuated over time as ritual centers. Sodan and the villages surrounding it are well over a thousand
    years old. They are the center of Sumbanese culture and the
    spiritual home of its Animist religion. All West Sumba villages claim their origin from this mountain
  area. It is vitally important to the Sumbanese culture that these
  villages are able to be rebuilt in the traditional way. THE SITUATION In the course of two months, the spiritual epicenter of the
    Lamboya Sumbanese culture has been decimated by two fires that
    destroyed the villages of Sodan and Ubbumaleha, burning them to the
    ground. 52 families (comprised of over 310 people) were affected by the
    tragedy and 48 ancestral homes were lost during the fires. With no food stock on hand, no opportunity to grow and harvest
  crops until May 2017, and an impending monsoon season that will cut
  off access to these villages and the surrounding area, it is truly a
  dire situation. SUMBA FOUNDATION The Sumba Foundation is a private, nonprofit,
  nongovernmental organization under the section 501 (c) (3) of the
  United States Internal Revenue Code. We are deeply committed to lessening the consequences of poverty
    for the people of Sumba by providing humanitarian aid through
    village based projects that impact health, education, and income
    generation all while preserving and respecting the fragile culture
    and traditions of the Sumbanese people. WE NEED YOUR HELP Funds are needed to assist and support the community for the
    next 9 months until the villagers can get their next rice harvest. Over the coming months we will need donations for food and water,
  medicines, mosquito nets, clothing for all ages, school uniforms &
  school supplies for 142 children, tools, temporary roofing and
  building materials, cooking implements, tarpaulins. BASIC

  Lac Courte Oreilles, (Hayward, WI) who was seriously injured in a car accident on the evening of December 28th, 2017. As of December 31, Michael had been through two different
  surgeries to stem internal bleeding, and to fuse/wire fractures on his
  pelvis and spine while he remained in a sedated medical coma in order
  to rest his body until January 2nd. Because of the accident he lost
  the use of one of his kidneys and will face a couple of months of rehabilitation. Michael is a member of the Corbine/Barber clan of the Lac Courte
