"461,814",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

164,Please donate towards Addisyn's Medical costs READ,Australian Dollar,,of $5k goal,2,"Addisyn Rose Simpson This is a long story, but please take the time to read all of
    it. Thank you! My tiny little princess Addi was born on the 08.12.2017 weighing 4
  pound 5 ounces, absolutely tiny for a full term baby but my little
  Addi unfortunately had other issues. Addisyn was my fourth child, I have Kade - 6 , Kobi - 3 & Ivy -
  15 months! After having 3 perfectly healthy beautiful babies prior I
  didn't expect to be told at my 20 week scan that I would have to go
  back for a specialist scan because they had found abnormalities in my
  daughters heart. Unfortunately worst then first thought Addisyn would be born to
  suffer from the worst congenital heart defect -Tetralogy of Fallot
  (TOF). Having TOF means that instead of one CHD Addisyn suffers from
  3+. Addi has 2 VSD's (holes in her heart) one being quite large that
  requires surgery before she is 6 months old, her outflow tract that
  connects her heart to her lungs is far too narrow, she has a thickened
  right ventricle & one of her main arteries is in the wrong
  position so it is not pumping blood the right way. The worst part
  about it all is the chd's she has all affects blood flow to her lungs,
  Addisyn is on a heart monitor consantly, she struggles with breathing
  quite often, she gets tired very quickly, her weight is stunted (she
  is nearly 2 months old and the same size as a normal newborn baby) ,
  she sometimes turns blue from lack of oxygen & even if she gets
  too wound up or loses her breath when she cries she will turn blue
  & start having seizures! TOF is fatal if left untreated, 50% of
  TOF sufferers who don't seek treatment die before the age of six!!
  That is why it is super important we get Addi all the help we can get
  for her! Unfortunately no one in Tasmania specialises in TOF so we have to
  travel to Melbourne to be seen for all of her appointments regarding
  her heart and even more unfortunately there is no funding allocated to
  help us with these travelling cost. Addi's first specialist
  appointment is booked for next month and we have had to pay $200 in
  flights return, $170 on a hotel in Melbourne CBD and we have had to
  put $200 aside for anything else I may have to pay for (taxi's, food
  etc) That is $570 just for one appointment and these are appointments
  Addi has to attend monthly until surgery. Addisyn has to have at least 3 open heart surgeries to correct her
  TOF. That makes for at least 3 times we have to fly to Melbourne and
  pay for accommodation for 3 weeks over there while she recovers! The
  Hospital will pay for Addisyn and myself's flights and subsided
  accommodation but if we want my husband & our 3 other children to
  be able to come and support there sister / daughter we will have to
  fund there flights and accommodation! I have spent no more then a full
  48 hours without seeing my children, if we are unable to afford to
  have them come to Melbourne with us I would be absolutely devastated
  and so distraught and with them only being 6, 3 & 14 months old
  they are far too young to be without there mother for 3 week periods!
  So PLEASE dig deep & if you are able to please donate to us to
  help fund Addisyn's Medical & travelling expenses we would be
  forever grateful!! We would love to be all kept together as a family!

"9,995",Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,U.S. Dollar,,of $125k goal,62,"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED:  MEDICAL AND BASIC LIVING EXPENSES Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special needs are met. I give him the peace of mind that I will
    never leave his side and the assurance he will always be safe.  With
    neither one of us working, continuing to pay for Jack’s medical
    expenses and our living expenses is an impossibility without the
    help of others. Not having medical insurance, we have received some
    financial help from the hospital’s social welfare department.
    However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will continue. We
    have monthly expenses in the USA that also add to our financial
    burden.  Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. BREAKDOWN OF MONTHLY EXPENSES I NEED HELP WITH WHILE JACK IS HOSPITLALIZED Monthly Medical at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital: average of
      $7205.50 USD $8,451.00 USD (Sept) $5,960.00 USD (Oct) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses (rent, utilities,
    internet/phones, transportation, food) :  $1,065.00 USD Monthly Upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
    loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses when Living at Home (rent, utilities, internet/phones, transportation,
    food): $1,215.00 USD Monthly upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
  loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) Radiation:  $2,000 USD (one time charge) When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will allow me to pay for our apartment
    rent, utilities, food and transportation expenses.  I can also pay
    my USA debts directly from USA checking account. The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen",https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack
"2,530",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,"Jul 6, 2018",of $40k goal,22,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor
"4,488",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,30,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for

      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness.

"8,211",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,77,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

"4,130",Hope For Sebastian,,,,,"Sebastian Major is 16 years old. He is a loving, caring young man who
  enjoys reading, video games, hanging out with his friends, and, like
  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.

"3,318",Support Black Panther Robert Seth Hayes!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,77,"Robert Seth Hayes is one of the longest held political prisoners in
  the US. After returning from the Vietnam War, Seth joined the Black
  Panther Party and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the
  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after
  serving 25 years he is eligible for parole. Seth has now been locked
  in prison for 42 years and unjustly denied parole on 10 occasions.
  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn
  for his release. Seth turns 67 this year and suffers from multiple
  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life
  in prison without the possibility parole. Seth is challenging this
  violation of his constitutional rights with a Habeas petition. Seth needs our support. Please make a contribution to this
  campaign to win justice and freedom for a brother who has sacrificed
  so much for us all!",https://fundrazr.com/810a58
"1,170",Please help Robert pay for his life-saving surgery,U.S. Dollar,"Mar 12, 2018",of $15k goal,6,"My name is Holly and I am doing this fundraiser for Robert's medical
  expenses. He has been one of the Three JellyBeans since 1971; we lost
  Bret Short, our other jellybean in October 2016. Robert has a long and difficult medical history, starting with
  his near-fatal wreck (as a passenger when an on-coming car nailed him
  and his friend) when we were in high-school. It was a long road back
  but he made it. He has the most giving heart of anyone I know, and truly would
  fit the cliche of giving someone the literal shirt off of his back. He
  is a very talented contractor/handyman and has worked for himself for
  many, many years. Like a lot of others these days, he has no health insurance. Robert had been having pains in his legs for a very long time
  that were mostly relieved by rest (rest being a thing Robert rarely
  gave himself). Fortunately, his neighbor flies for LifeFlight and
  recognized the pain, now unrelieved by rest, the ghost-white shade of
  his right leg and its icy coldness as being a serious problem and took
  him to the ER on Sunday (Jan. 7th). He has had many expensive
  diagnostic tests and imaging studies to isolate the problem and
  develop the treatment plan. The fantastic news is the heart cath showed only minor issues
  that can be treated with a statin. The dreadful news is his right
  iliac artery is 100% blocked and the left is 97%. The endarterectomy
  and possible stenting should be straightforward but for the fact that
  access is problematic due to the extreme amount of scar tissue from
  his long-ago car accident. As of this writing, he is on Day 4 of
  hospitalization and is in pre-op awaiting the surgery. With the
  blockage he has, not having the surgery would result in gangrene and
  ultimate loss of his limbs. Not acceptable!! The recovery, if all goes as planned, shouldn't be much worse
  than those having a femoral-access heart cath. A day of
  flat-on-the-back, then gradual resumption of the activities of daily living. Robert has a sister, who has a family with its own health issues
  and she herself has recently suffered a stroke. She is a retired
  schoolteacher and even the family resources are limited. I am helping Robert to navigate the options with the hospital's
  social worker and financial assistance departments, and to negotiate
  downward the final medical bills. Nonethless, they will be many and
  massive. The last thing Robert needs is stress about how he will pay
  for this. Being self-employed, no work means no pay. Having a highly
  physical job, light duty restrictions for a while greatly impacts his
  ability to earn a living. What he does have is a vast support group of friends, many for
  forty years or more. And while we all have our own financial issues,
  the power of crowdsourcing means even small amounts from friends,
  extended friends, and perhaps some compassionate and generous
  strangers will help him to meet his medical bills, and make sure the
  lights stay on. I will make sure food stays in his fridge, that he has
  the transportation to medical appointments he needs, and have offered
  him my guest room and ""nursing skills"" as he recovers. I ask you all to contribute however you can -- nothing is too
  small an amount. I of course obtained Robert's permission to raise
  these funds, and he agreed (although he's not a fan of the limelight,
  much less of sharing his needs: he has volunteered for years with the
  Red Cross, going in when families are burned out of their homes to
  provide lodging, food, and clothing, and he is far more comfortable
  being the helper, not the person in need). If you don't know Robert but you know me, please consider giving
  anyway. Since losing my beloved husband to metastatic colon cancer the
  week before Thanksgiving, I have been heartbroken and lost and in
  search of a purpose. THIS is now my purpose so any support you can
  give is as meaningful to me as it is to Robert. Sincere and heartfelt thanks in advance from me and from Robert,
  for reading to the end, and for giving whatever you can. N.B.: While not required by this site, Robert and I both feel a
  moral obligation to report how any funds raised are spent. We will not
  identify, for example, a specific doctor by name; however, we would
  share that ""$xxx was paid to the vascular surgeon at Piedmont
  Hospital for the surgery,"" or ""$xxx to the hospital for room
  and related charges,"" or ""$xx to the pharmacy for his
  medications."" There's just so much fraud and scammy stuff in the
  world, we hope this provides confidence to the donors. [I will provide an update after the surgery and as he
  progresses. This could be a very long road.]",https://fundrazr.com/61Jmqc

  born in the UK but since 2002 I have been living in Thailand and
  working in the surrounding countries. Up untill May 2016 I was all set to save enough money to have SRS
  surgery to complete my journey to become female.... I came out in 2015
  and have luckly had the support from friends and family.. Unfortunately I was not so lucky concerning my employment... I was
  'let go'from my position (unofficially for being transgender) and have
  since been unable to find employment ANYWHERE ... I worked in the
  experimental education industry for 20 years. But it is now apparent
  companies do not want to hire me due to fear of backlash from parents
  having a transgender individual interacting with their children.!! My insurance does not cover this surgery I am barely able to support myself let alone my family Due to the nature of my skill set. My age and my location and the
  fact that I am openly transgender I am in a situation where I Have
  become unemployable! This loss of financial security and stoppage placed upon my
  transition has caused me to fall into a  state of anxiety and
  depression.. And a close suicide attempt..  I must pull myself out of
  this  for the sake of myself and my family..they need their leader back. I'm a firm believer in working for the things you need and I have a
  hard work ethic.. I would even cancel this fundraiser if someone out
  there could offer me a job instead of the $10... I have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to save for
  this surgery  as any money I can make from small consultancy work goes
  straight to the family as their needs come first. I don't like asking for help..and I don't think I can fully explain
  just how important this surgery means to me... That's why I am looking
  for people who can understand or empathize with my situation.. I am
  more than happy to talk with anyone should they wish to know more
  about me. My family. My life.. But it is hard to convey  this in a few
  short words and expect people to understand... I just hope there are enough decent people out there who will help if
  they can... All I ask is for $10....and it will literally change not
  only my life but also that of my family... Thank you for your time Jaisha",https://fundrazr.com/Jaishakaniz

"2,955",Help for Howard,U.S. Dollar,,of $11.3k goal,25,"Written diligently on my phone over many hours as we are presently
  without a working computer in our home... Hey All- While it seemed that nothing but fake news was all that one could
  find wherever one looked, my world just got very real with some
  information regarding my health. Briefly, here is the gist of it all... Recently I've been struggling with issues of balance and hearing and
  was referred to a neurologist and subsequently to have an MRI of my head. These scans revealed a growth on my right side, and I was diagnosed
  with a vestibular schwannoma. So, what is that anyway? I know, it sounds like a sandwich, but in fact is a slow growing
  tumor originating off of my auditory nerve. Sometimes called an auditory neuroma, these growths are considered
  pretty rare overall. The good news is that it is self-contained and benign. The growth is not actually in my brain, but rather beginning to press
  on various nerves which are associated with my ability to walk,
  balance and function particularly affecting my right side. Apparently this thing has been growing for  20-30 years and first
  began to reach a size to where its presence affected the
  aforementioned nerves a few short months ago and has me to the point
  of my  not getting around that well. Given the size of the tumor and the ways it is impacting my life, the
  best option is a surgery to remove the growth. Eventually, if not removed or somehow reduced in size, the tumor will
  continue its slow but steady growth and my functionality will decrease
  and at some point my brain will run out of room to accommodate this
  impeding guest. This could be another 20-30 years but I am already experiencing
  significant loss of my abilities and quality of life. I am a total proponent of our own innate abilities to reduce and/or
  reverse growths and such in our bodies and surgery has been something
  that I've shied away from even until recently. Hell, I've spent most of the last 20+ years working tirelessly to
  hold this perspective for clients who have lost sight of these very truths. That said, I still come from the same place but am humbly, after much
  inner dialogue, choosing to go ahead with the surgery. Honestly I reached this decision after realizing that I lacked a
  certain strength and really needed help. The surgery is scheduled for the morning of the 12th and will take
  about 5 hours. This is unfamiliar ground for me, as it surely is for most. I am pretty scared and well out of my comfort zone! Following the surgery, my stay in the hospital should only be 3-5
  days with a possible indeterminate time at an in-patient rehab
  facility thereafter. The length of time at the rehab will depend on how well and quickly I
  can recalibrate and recover my abilities to balance and walk, etc... As far as recovery and returning to work, I'm being told a month
  depending on how I respond. The other day I had the occasion to speak with a local woman who
  underwent basically the same procedure a few years ago and she related
  it taking almost 3 months before she was feeling ready to get back to
  her job. Everyone is different and each case unique, I get that.  What I mean
  to say is that there are many unknowns... Hence my creating this campaign to ask for your financial assistance. I have not worked in at least a month, and it's been 2 or more since
  I've done anything full time. Fortunately I do have insurance, albeit limited coverage, through my
  wife's employer, but the bills are already beginning to wrack up. With doctor visits, running here and there, plus 2 MRIs the costs are
  already well beyond our means with the surgery, hospital stay and
  potential rehab yet to come. I'm not going to endlessly post asking for your assistance. If you can or want to donate towards this, cool. And if you can't or don't want to, also cool. Share or don't share as you see fit, both are good. I'm not going to make any promises here  that could come around to
  weigh upon me should I be unable to fulfill them. Please don't be put off by the goal, as this  amount was only set to
  not limit our cause here. Of course anything offered is a great gesture of kindness and totally appreciated! Lastly, I really hope to impart that what is most relevant and
  welcomed is your words and love during this time. Yes the money piece is important, and something that really takes a
  lot of my energy as I worry about that side of things  but what I
  truly seek right now is connection with those I love. If you are reading this then in some way you fall into that category. I'm not very communicative especially on social media, and definitely
  even less so as of late. I wasn't in the right awareness until now to fully disclose all that
  I've been dealing with. Part of my way of addressing things is to reach further into my own
  depths for understanding. Sometimes this can be interpreted as polarizing or dismissive but I
  assure you this has not been my intention. I'm simply trying to be okay, like we all are. I guess I'm a stoically private guy when it comes to my personal
  life, but for those who do have interest I wanted to share some of
  what's been going down with me. Peace and Thank You, Howard",https://fundrazr.com/01EjG6

  being transferred there from Toronto General Hospital, and is at risk
  for organ damage in his lungs and heart, his kidneys are functioning
  at 0% capacity, and his lower limbs are at risk for amputation. He is
  currently on daily dialysis, and has not recovered most of his

  ages 12 -16. He is also in the process of completing his
  professional refereeing licenses. Paul recently purchased his first home, a condo close to home, where

645,Help me help others thrive through Ayurveda!,Pound Sterling,"Feb 9, 2018",of £3.5k goal,17,"Help Me Activate Innate Wellness Potential Do you feel somewhat (or more significantly) off, or out of
  sync? Is your current lifestyle taking a toll on your sleep,
  energy, or diet, but you don't know how to resolve this?  Or maybe
  you've plateaued, but know that there's always room for improvement,
  and aren't sure what to do... We're in the age of information overwhelm and are regularly bombarded
  with advice on what we should and shouldn't be doing to be healthy. On
  top of figuring out what to do amidst all the information
  clutter, change can be HARD. But I can show you what changes to make to dramatically uplevel
    your health AND make it EASY & FUN through wisdom from Ayurveda
    &the science of habit change. You can help me do this with your donation. It's become increasingly apparent to me that individual and
    collective mind-body-spirit integrity is necessaryfor catalyzing
    positive social change in the world. That's what I've come to
  appreciate after years of involvement in, and study of, environmental
  and social justice movements, and I hope you can help me! My Story ​ I thought I had a fairly healthy lifestyle - I cycled everywhere, ate
  'healthily', etc.  Still, I didn't feel as well as one might expect I
  should feel with that lifestyle. And despite my seemingly healthy life, I developed an arrhythmia,
      out of nowhere. Thankfully, the doctors stated it was a 'non-worrisome' kind, as far
  as arrhythmias go, but anyone who has routinely experienced their
  heart skipping beats and then pounding on and off throughout the day
  knows it's not pleasant. The cardiologist and my GP didn't couldn't
  shed any light on why this was happening, how to stop it, and simply
  told me that I could take anti-anxiety meds if the arrhythmia itself
  was distressing me. I tried various things (working out, meditation, herbs, acupuncture),
  and they all certainly benefited me in various ways but didn't resolve
  my arrhythmia. I was still lacking the set of simple, foundational
  elements for well being. At some point, I started exploring Ayurveda, an ancient wellness
  tradition of India, where my ancestors hail from. There were aspects
  of it that I grew up with but had lost touch with, and other aspects
  that were new to me. But even after learning this, changing my
    lifestyle accordingly proved impossible until I tried combining core
    elements of Ayurvedic self-care with applied behavioral science. This is the missing piece that seemed to recalibrate me, and I
    can't remember the last time I've experienced arrhythmia, something
    that had plagued me for five years. The amazing thing is that I
    wasn't even trying to sort out my heart condition - I had tried for
    five years and had accepted that it was something I had to live
    with. And that's often what happens when people live more in
    alignment with natural rhythms - issues like excess weight resolve
    themselves without specifically working on them. What is Ayurveda & how can it help you? Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term that literally means 'science of 
    life', but has also been translated as 'the art of living' and 'the
    science of longevity'. Aspects, particular from the food
  side of it, are becoming increasingly trendy e.g. ghee, turmeric
  everything, etc.  But what it really comes down to, and in this sense has in common
    with other traditions, is living in alignment with the natural order/natural law/rhythms
    of nature, rather than against it. And it's this alignment
  that is just as important as diet, exercise, etc.  We can be eating
  well and be relatively fit but still have habits that sabotage our
  innate restorative capacity and/or generate a kind of debris that
  clogs our mind-body-spirit landscape. The impacts will manifest at
  different times and different ways depending on our individual
  make-up. Interestingly,there are now a number of biomedical studies
  showing the adverse effects of violating natural cycles. Moreover, our habits will shape our health in the next 10, 20, 30+
  years, and if you're reading this, it's not too early or too late for
  you to adopt life-affirming ones. If you want to preserve your
    mind-body-spirit for the duration of your time here on earth - to
    serve as best you can for as long as possible - isn't it worth
    putting the effort in to establish these habits now? Results All kinds of people can benefit from incorporating these
      daily routines - from people who may have a poor diet and inactive
      lifestyle to those at the other end of the
  spectrum. Fortunately, we are incredibly resilient,
  and continuous small changes can have dramatic results. The results
  for people who have successfully incorporated these habits into their
  lives include: - being naturally energized and no longer dependent on caffeine -more rejuvenating rest -more focus throughout day -losing excess weight without trying -freeing up time/having more time in schedule -being able to parent calmly and effectively -having more rewarding time with spouse and children -being more focused and efficient in home and work life -more trust in intuition around eating -skill in facilitating family members, including children,

349,Help Dad see his future in color,U.S. Dollar,"Jan 30, 2018",of $349 goal,3,"Many of you know my dad, Randy Greeson. Many of you personally know
  him. If you know one thing about him it is that he works his butt off
  every single say to provide for always his family first. I am the
  lucky daughter of this man and I am here asking for your help. My dad
  lost his job in 2016. He put his pride aside and him and my mom came
  and lived with us. He lost his house, his job and his dog all in one
  year. Since moving down here he has had ups and downs but still
  continues to work his butt off. He puts family first and many of you
  may not be blood family but, you sure felt like you belonged in his
  house. I need help raising money for these glasses for my dad. I think
  2018 should be positive for him and to see it in color would help the
  his outlook on life. He would finally be able to see how beautiful my
  mothers eyes are, and even the simple things such as green trees.
  Please help me make my dads future bright and help me make it known to
  him how much love and support he has in his life.",https://fundrazr.com/11Jbp9
